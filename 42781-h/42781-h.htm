<h3>OUR SEVENTH VOLUME.</h3>

  <p>We might, without any offence against truth or modesty, begin our
  Seventh Volume by congratulating ourselves and our Readers on the
  continued success and increasing circulation of our work. As to Truth,
  our Readers can only judge in part, and must take our word for the rest;
  but they may see enough in our pages to lead them to do so. Let them but
  look at the signatures which from time to time appear in our columns, and
  they will see enough to prove that we have the sanction of a list of
  names, high in literary reputation, such as it might seem ostentatious to
  parade in our columns on an occasion like the present. We abstain the
  more readily, because we have felt it our duty to do the thing so
  frequently and fully in our prospectuses. And as to Modesty, can there be
  any want of it in saying that with such&mdash;or perhaps we should say by
  such&mdash;contributors we have produced a work which the public has
  found acceptable? With such contributors, and others whom we should be
  proud to name with them, if they had given names which we cannot but
  know, but do not feel authorised to decypher&mdash;with such help, what
  sort of animal must an editor be who could fail to make a work worth
  reading? In fact, if not our highest praise, it is the plainest proof of
  the value of our publication, that we have done little or nothing except
  to give the reader the greatest possible quantity of matter in a legible
  form, wholly unassisted by graphic ornament or artistic decoration of any
  kind&mdash;without even the attraction of politics, scandal, or
  polemics.</p>

  <p>Our pride is that we are useful; and that fact is proved by another to
  which it has given rise, namely, that we are favoured with many more
  contributions than we can possibly find room for; and therefore, instead
  of employing the occasion which offers for a few words with our Readers,
  by way of introduction to a new Volume, in any protracted remarks on what
  we have done, we would rather confer with them on the ways and means of
  doing more.</p>

  <p>In the first place, let us say explicitly that we do not mean by the
  most obvious method of increasing the bulk of our publication. It is
  quite clear that we <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>could print twice as much on twice as many
  pages; but this is not what we mean. Those who refer to our earliest
  Numbers will see "how we are grown," and we are perfectly convinced that
  we are now quite grown up&mdash;that our quantity (to change the figure)
  is quite as much as our company wish to see set on the table at once, and
  our price quite as agreeable as if it were larger; for to enlarge the
  work without enlarging the price would be quite out of the question.</p>

  <p>But, in the course of what we may now call considerable experience,
  during which we have seen the work grow up into the form which it now
  wears, we have been led to think, that if our friends will allow us to
  offer a few suggestions (on which some of them may perhaps improve), we
  may be able, with the same space and cost, to oblige more Correspondents;
  and not only by that means, but by rendering our information more select
  and valuable, increase the gratification of our Readers.</p>

  <p>Our name suggests the idea of a work consisting of two parts; and,
  with regard to the first, we can only offer such obvious remarks as, that
  the more a writer condenses what he has to say, the less room his
  communication will occupy in print&mdash;and the less room he occupies,
  the more he will leave for others, &amp;c. These are weighty and
  important truths, but such as we need not insist on.</p>

  <p>But when we look at the other part, passing under the single name of
  "<span class="sc">Queries</span>," it becomes obvious that our work,
  instead of having, as its title would import, what Sir Thomas Browne
  calls a "bicapitous conformation," does in fact consist of three parts,
  which must be ranged under three different heads, and dealt with in three
  different ways. A little, modest, demure-looking <span
  class="sc">Query</span> slips into print, and by the time it has been in
  print a fortnight, we find that it has a large family of <span
  class="sc">Replies</span>, who all come about it, and claim a settlement
  on the ground of their parentage.</p>

  <p>Now, it is on this matter that we think some improvement may be made.
  We would not on any account diminish our number of <span
  class="sc">Queries</span>, and would wish even our <span
  class="sc">Notes</span> to be notes of interrogation as well as
  information. But between <span class="sc">Queries</span> and <span
  class="sc">Replies</span>, notwithstanding their family connexion, there
  is an essential difference. In every case the <span
  class="sc">Query</span>, in order to its answering the end for which it
  is proposed, must be public; but in a great many cases the <span
  class="sc">Reply</span> need not be so. The <span class="sc">Query</span>
  may be a very proper and curious one, and interesting in a high degree to
  the proposer and several other persons, but the <span
  class="sc">Reply</span> to it may involve details not generally
  interesting.<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  We shall not be thought to discourage such inquiries (while we consider
  the opportunity which we afford for making them one of the most valuable
  features of our work) if we illustrate this by suggesting that A. wishes
  for genealogical or family history; B. wants to know what the author of
  such or such a book which he is editing means by such or such a
  reference; C., who is editing another, wants a collation of this or that
  edition; D., who is writing a third book, in order to correct and enrich
  it, wants as many things (and heartily glad should we be to help him to
  get them) as would occupy half-a-dozen of our Numbers; and so we might go
  on, were it not quite unnecessary to pursue in detail the illustration of
  what is so plain. Now it has occurred to us, that if Correspondents who
  wish to make inquiries, the answers to which would obviously be of no
  general interest, would, with their Query, enclose a stamped envelope,
  directed in any way which they may think proper, it would often be in our
  power not only to transmit to them answers to their inquiries, but to put
  them in direct communication with those who could give them further
  information; and who would in many cases communicate with individuals of
  whose respectability and capacity they were satisfied, more freely than
  they would through a public channel. We shall be glad to know how far
  such a plan would be approved of. We must add, that it would enable us to
  make use of many <span class="sc">Replies</span> which it is impossible,
  under present circumstances, to insert; and we believe that many
  Answerers would not only be as well pleased to learn that their <span
  class="sc">Replies</span> had been transmitted to the Querist, but that,
  with a knowledge that they would be so transmitted, they would write with
  more freedom and fulness than if they expected the <span
  class="sc">Reply</span> to be published. One thing only we should bargain
  for&mdash;and, having cut ourselves off from all hope of gain by desiring
  to have the envelopes directed, we think we have a right to ask
  it&mdash;it is, that if in this correspondence, of which we are the
  medium, they come to any curious and generally interesting results, they
  will send them to us, <i>pro bono publico</i>.</p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote1"></a><b>Footnote 1:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag1">(return)</a>
  <p>A valued Correspondent, who has strongly urged the adoption of the
  course which we are now recommending to our Readers, thus illustrates his
  position:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It seems to be a very good thing to have a medium of genealogical
  inquiry; but why should all the world be troubled with the answers to a
  man who writes,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Again, supposing X. Y. wants to borrow some not very common book
  which one happens to have, I am not going to write (and if I did so write
  you would not print it), 'If X. Y., as soon as he sees this, will call on
  the Pump at Aldgate, he will find my copy of the book tied to the spout,
  if the charity boys have not cribbed it; and he can return it or not,
  according to his conscience, if he has any."</p>

<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>PROCLAMATIONS OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES, AND THEIR VALUE AS HISTORICAL EVIDENCES.</h3>

  <p>The work that is now going on at the Society of Antiquaries in
  reference to the collection of royal proclamations in their library, is
  one in which not merely the Fellows of that Society, but all historical
  students, are deeply interested. The Society possesses one of the three
  known largest collections of these public documents. They were formerly
  bound up in volumes of several different sizes, intermixed with a variety
  of fugitive publications, such as ballads and broadsides, which formed
  altogether a very incongruous collection. A short time since it was found
  that the binding of many of the volumes was very much worn, and that some
  of the documents themselves had been considerably torn and damaged. Under
  these circumstances, Mr. Lemon, of the State Paper Office, offered his
  services to the Council to superintend an entire new arrangement,
  mounting, binding, and calendaring, of the whole series of proclamations.
  His offer was of course gratefully accepted, and the work is now in
  active progress.</p>

  <p>The collection is certainly the most important that is known, and is
  especially so in the reign of Elizabeth; in reference to which there is
  no collection at all approaching to it, either in completeness or value.
  Still there are many proclamations wanting: several of the Fellows of the
  Society have come forward most liberally to fill up gaps. <span
  class="sc">Mr. Payne Collier</span> led the way in a contribution of
  great value; <span class="sc">Mr. Salt</span> followed <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> with a munificent donation of a whole
  collection relating to Charles II. and James II.; and upon Mr. Lemon's
  suggestion, and with the joint concurrence of Mr. Secretary Walpole and
  the Keeper of the State Paper Office, an interchange of duplicates has
  been effected between that office and the Society of Antiquaries, which
  has added forty proclamations to the Society's collection.</p>

  <p>My principal reason for addressing you upon this subject is to ask you
  to suggest to your readers that a similar interchange of duplicates might
  be effected between the Society and any persons who chance to have
  duplicate proclamations in their possession.</p>

  <p>It is of the very highest literary and historical importance that we
  should get together, in some accessible place, a collection of
  proclamations, which if not actually complete (a consummation hardly to
  be expected), shall yet approach to completeness. The collection at
  Somerset House offers the best opportunity for forming such a collection.
  It is by far the most nearly complete in existence, and is strong in that
  particular part of the series in which other collections are most
  defective, and in which missing proclamations are the most difficult to
  be supplied. At the Society of Antiquaries the collection will be
  accessible to all literary inquirers, and no doubt the Society will
  publish a proper catalogue, which is already in preparation by Mr.
  Lemon.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that any person who chooses to contribute such stray
  proclamations, or copies of proclamations, as he may chance to have in
  his possession, will be helping forward a really good work, and the
  possessor of duplicates may not only do the same, but may benefit his own
  collection by an interchange.</p>

  <p>The value of proclamations as historical authorities, and especially
  as authorities for the history of manners, and of our national progress,
  is indisputable. As I write, I have before me the <i>Booke of
  Proclamations</i> of James I. from 1603 to 1609; and the page lying open
  affords a striking illustration of what I assert. It gives us <span
  class="sm">A CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR POST-OFFICE</span>.</p>

  <p>Immediately on the accession of James I., the high north road from
  London to Edinburgh was thronged with multitudes of pilgrims hastening to
  the worship of the newly risen sun. Robert Carey became, in the words of
  Cowper's enigma, "the parent of numbers that cannot be told." Scotland
  has never poured into the south more active or more anxious suppliants
  than then traversed the northward road through Berwick. All ordinary
  accommodation soon fell short of the demand. Messengers riding post from
  the council to the king were stayed on the road for want of the ordinary
  supply of post-horses, all which were taken up by lords and
  gentry&mdash;rushing northward in the fury of their new-born loyalty. As
  a remedy for these inconveniences, the lords of the council issued a
  proclamation, calling upon all magistrates to aid the postmasters "in
  this time so full of business," by seeing that they are supplied with
  "fresh and able horses as necessitie shall require." Of course the supply
  was merely of horses. Travellers could not in those days obtain carriages
  of any kind. The horses were directed to be "able and sufficient horses,
  and well furnished of saddles, bridles, girts and stirropes, with good
  guides to looke to them; who for their said horses shall demand and
  receive of such as shall ride on them, the prices accustomed."</p>

  <p>The new state of things became permanent. London, after James's
  removal from Edinburgh, being really the seat of government for the whole
  island, the intercourse both ways was continuous, and further general
  orders for its management were published by proclamation. There were at
  that time, on all the high roads through the country, two sorts of
  posts:&mdash;1. Special messengers or couriers who rode "thorough post,"
  that is, themselves rode through the whole distance, "with horn and
  guide." Such persons carried with them an authentication of their
  employment in the <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>public service. In 1603, they were charged
  "two-pence halfe-peny the mile" (raised in 1609 to threepence) for the
  hire of each horse, "besides the guide's groats." The hire was to be paid
  beforehand. They were not to ride the horses more than one stage, except
  with the consent of "the post of the stage" at which they did not change.
  Nor were they to charge the horse "with any male or burden (besides his
  rider) that exceedeth the weight of thirtye pounds." Nor to ride more
  than seven miles an hour in summer or six in winter. 2. The other sort of
  post was what was termed the "post for the packet." For this service
  every postmaster was bound to keep horses ready; and on receipt of a
  "packet" or parcel containing letters, he was to send it on towards the
  next stage within a quarter of an hour after its arrival, entering the
  transaction in "a large and faire ledger paper book." Two horses were to
  be kept constantly ready for this service, "with furniture convenient,"
  and messengers "at hand in areadinesse." The postmaster was also to have
  ready "two bags of leather, at the least, well lined with bayes or
  cotton, to carry the packet in." He was also to have ready "hornes to
  sound and blow, as oft as the post meets company, or foure times in every
  mile."</p>

  <p>The "post for the packet" was at first used only for the carriage of
  despatches for the government or for ambassadors, but a similar mode of
  conveyance soon began to be taken advantage of by merchants and private
  persons. Difficulty in obtaining posts and horses for the conveyance of
  private packets, led to the interference of "certain persons called
  hackney-men, tapsters, hostlers, and others, in hiring out their horses,
  to the hinderance of publique service, danger to our state, and wrong to
  our standing and settled postes in their several stages." The government
  of James I. thought, in its blindness, that it could put a stop to the
  dangerous practice of transmitting unofficial letters, by rendering it
  penal for private persons to carry them; that of Charles I., wiser, in
  this respect, in its generation, settled a scheme for their general
  conveyance through the medium of "a letter office." But the "post for the
  packet," with his leathern bag and his twanging horn (the origin, of
  course, of our mail-coach horn), continued down to a late period, and
  probably still lingers in some parts of the kingdom. Cowper, it will be
  remembered, describes him admirably.</p>

<h3>CURIOSITIES OF ADVERTISING LITERATURE.</h3>

  <p>We are all well acquainted with the ingenious artifices by which
  modern advertisers thrust their wares upon the attention of newspaper
  readers. We may, perhaps, have been betrayed into the expression of come
  rude Saxon expletive, when, in the columns devoted to news and general
  information, we have in our innocence been tempted with a paragraph that
  commenced with "a clever saying of the illustrious Voltaire's," and
  dovetailed into a panegyric of Messrs. Aaron and Son's Reversible
  Paletots; or we may have applauded the clever logician who so clearly
  demonstrates, that as Napoleon's bilious affection frequently clouded his
  judgment in times of greatest need, the events of the present century,
  and the fate of nations, would have been reversed, had that great man
  only been persuaded to take two boxes of Snooks's Aperient Pill, price
  1<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i>, with the Government stamp on a red ground (see
  Advt.). All these things we know very well; but, of the fugitive
  literature that does not find a place in the advertising columns of
  <i>The Times</i>, but flashes into Fame only in the pages of some local
  oracle, or in some obscurer broad-sheet, how often must it remain
  unappreciated, and doomed to "waste its sweetness on the desert air."
  That this may not be said of the following burst of advertising
  eloquence, I trust it may be found worthy a niche in the temple of "N.
  &amp; Q." In its composition the author was probably inspired by the
  grand scenery of the Cheviots, in a village near to which his shop was
  situate. It was one of those "generally-useful" shops where the grocer
  and draper held equal reign, and anything could be got, from silks and
  satins to butter and Bath bricks. The composition was printed and
  distributed among the neighbouring families; but shortly after, when the
  author heard that it had not produced the exact effect he had wished, he,
  with the irritability that often accompanies genius, resolved to get back
  and destroy every copy of his production, and deny to the world that
  which it could not appreciate. Fortunately for the world's welfare, I
  preserved a copy of his hand-bill, of which this, in its turn, is a
  faithful transcript:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="ac">"<i>To the Inhabitants of G. and its neighbourhood.</i></p>

  <p>"The present age is teeming with advantages which no preceding Era in
  the history of mankind has afforded to the human family. New schemes are
  projecting to enlighten and extend civilisation, Railways have been
  projected and carried out by an enterprising and spirited nation, while
  Science in its gigantic power (simple yet sublime) affords to the humane
  mind so many facilities to explore its rich resources, the Seasons roll
  on in their usual course producing light and heat, the vivifying rays of
  the Sun, and the fructifying influences of nature producing food and
  happiness to the Sons of Toil; while to the people of G. and its
  neighbourhood a rich and extensive variety of Fashionable Goods is to be
  found in my Warehouse, which have just been selected with the greatest
  care. The earliest visit is requested to convey to the mind an adequate
  idea of the great extent of his purchases, comprising as it does all that
  is elegant and useful, cheap and substantial, to the light-hearted

  derangement of epitaphs:" and, us for the rest, surely "the force of"
  bathos "could no further go."</p>

<h3>ON A PASSAGE IN "KING HENRY VIII.," ACT III. SC. 2.</h3>

  <p>One of the most desperately unintelligible passages in Shakspeare
  occurs in this play, in the scene between the King and the Cardinal, when
  the latter professes his devoted attachment to his service. It stands
  thus in the first folio:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="gap"></span><i>Car.</i> "I do professe</p>
      <p>That for your Highnesse good, I euer labour'd</p>
      <p>More then mine owne: that am, haue, and will be</p>
      <p>(Though all the world should cracke their duty to you,</p>
      <p>And throw it from their Soule, though perils did</p>
      <p>Abound, as thicke as thought could make 'em, and</p>
      <p>Appeare in formes more horrid) yet my Duty,</p>
      <p>As doth a Rocke against the chiding Flood,</p>
      <p>Should the approach of this wilde Riuer breake,</p>
      <p>And stand vnshaken yours."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Upon this Mason observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I can find no meaning in these words (that am, have, and will be), or
  see how they are connected with the rest of the sentence; and should
  therefore strike them out."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Malone says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I suppose the meaning is, '<i>that</i> or <i>such a man</i>, I am,
  have <i>been</i>, and will <i>ever</i> be.' Our author has many hard and
  forced expressions in his plays; but many of the hardnesses in the piece
  before us appear to me of a different colour from those of Shakspeare.
  Perhaps however, a line following has been lost; for in the old copy
  there is no stop at the end of this line; and, indeed, I have some doubt
  whether a comma ought not to be placed at it, rather than a
  fullpoint."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Knight, however, places a fullpoint at <i>will be</i>, and
  says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is certainly some corruption in this passage; for no ellipsis
  can have taken this very obscure form. Z. Jackson suggests 'that <i>aim
  has</i> and will be.' This is very harsh. We might read 'That <i>aim</i>
  I have and will,' <i>will</i> being a noun."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Collier has the following note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In this place we can do no more than reprint exactly the old text,
  with the old punctuation; as if Wolsey, following 'that am, have, and
  will be' by a long parenthesis, had forgotten how he commenced his
  sentence. Something may have been lost, which would have completed the
  meaning and the instances have not been infrequent where lines, necessary
  to the sense, have been recovered from the quarto impressions. Here we
  have no quarto impressions to resort to, and the later folios afford us
  no assistance, as they reprint the passage as it stands in the folio
  1628, excepting that the two latest end the parenthesis at 'break.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I cannot think that the poet would have put a short speech into
  Wolsey's mouth, making him forget how he commenced it! Nor do I believe
  that anything has been lost, except the slender letter <i>I</i> preceding
  <i>am</i>. The printer or transcriber made the easy mistake of taking the
  word <i>true</i> for <i>haue</i>, which as written of old would readily
  occur, and having thus confused the passage, had recourse to the
  unconscionable long mark of a parenthesis. The passage undoubtedly should
  stand thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="gap"></span><i>Car.</i> "I do profess</p>
      <p>That for your highness' good I ever labour'd</p>
      <p>More than mine own; that <i>I</i> am <i>true</i>, and will be</p>
      <p>Though all the world should <i>lack</i> their duty to you,</p>
      <p>And throw it from their soul: though perils did</p>
      <p>Abound, as thick as thought could make them, and</p>
      <p>Appear in forms more horrid; yet my duty</p>
      <p>(As doth a rock against the chiding flood,)</p>
      <p>Should the approach of this wild river break,</p>
      <p>And stand unshaken yours."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here all is congruous and clear. This slight correction of a palpable
  printer's error redeems a fine passage hitherto entirely unintelligible.
  I do not insist upon the correction in the fourth line of <i>lack</i> for
  <i>crack</i>, yet what can be meant by <i>cracking a duty</i>? The duke,
  in the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, speaks of his daughter as
  "<i>lacking</i> duty;" and seeing how very negligently the whole passage
  has been given in the folio, I think there is good ground for its
  reception. With regard to the correction in the second line, I feel
  confident, and doubt not that it will have the approbation of all who,
  like myself, feel assured that most of the difficulties in the text of
  our great poet are attributable to careless printer or transcriber.</p>

  <p>When I proposed (Vol. vi., p. 468.) to read "<i>rail</i> at once,"
  instead of "<i>all</i> at once," in <i>As You Like It</i>, Act III. Sc.
  5., I thought the conjecture my own, having then only access to the
  editions of Mr. Collier and Mr. Knight; I consequently said, "It is
  somewhat singular that the passage should hitherto have passed
  unquestioned." My surprise was therefore great, on turning to the passage
  in the <i>Variorum Shakspeare</i>, to find the following note by
  Warburton, which had escaped my notice:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If the speaker intended to accuse the person spoken to only for
  <i>insulting</i> and exulting, then, instead of '<i>all</i> at once,' it
  ought to have been <i>both</i> at once. But, examining the crime of the
  person accused, we shall discover that the line is to be read thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'That you insult, exult, and <i>rail</i> at once,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>for these three things Ph&oelig;be was guilty of. But the Oxford
  editor improves it, and, for <i>rail</i> at once, reads
  <i>domineer</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have no recollection of having ever read the note before, and
  certainly was not conscious of it. The coincidence, therefore, may be
  considered (as Mr. Collier observed in respect to the reading of
  <i>palpable</i> for <i>capable</i>) as much in favour of this conjecture.
  <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span></p>

  <p>That the most careful printers can <i>misread</i>, and consequently
  <i>misprint</i>, copy, is evident from the following error in my last
  Note:&mdash;Vol. vi., p. 584., col. 1, for "in the edition which I gave
  of the <i>part</i>," read "<i>poet</i>." This mistake, like most of those
  I have indicated in the first folio Shakspeare, might easily occur if the
  word was indistinctly written.</p>

<h3>LATIN POEMS IN CONNEXION WITH WATERLOO.</h3>

  <p>I send you two copies of Latin verses which have not, to my knowledge,
  appeared in print. They are however interesting, from the coincidence of
  their both relating to <i>elm-trees</i>, and in some measure belonging to
  the "Story of Waterloo," about which we never can hear too much. The
  lines themselves possess considerable merit; and, as their authors were
  respectively distinguished alumni of Eton and Winchester, I hope to see
  both compositions placed in juxtaposition in the columns of "N. &amp;
  Q."</p>

  <p>The first of these productions was written by Marquis Wellesley, as an
  inscription for a chair carved from the <i>Wellington Elm</i> (which
  stood near the centre of the British lines on the field of Waterloo), and
  presented to his Majesty King George IV., to whom the lines were
  addressed:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ampla inter spolia, et magni decora alta triumphi,</p>
      <p class="i1"><i>Ulmus</i> erit fastis commemoranda tuis,</p>
      <p>Quam super exoriens faustâ tibi gloria pennâ</p>
      <p class="i1">Palmam oleamque uno detulit alma die;</p>
      <p>Immortale decus maneat, famâque perenni</p>

      <p>Et tua victrices dum cingunt tempora lauri,</p>
      <p class="i1">Materies solio digna sit ista tuo.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>For the other verses subjoined, we are indebted to the late Rev.
  William Crowe, Fellow of New College, Oxford, and many years public
  orator in that university. It seems that he had planted <i>an elm</i> at
  his parsonage, on the birth of his son, afterwards killed at Waterloo,
  which sad event was <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>SIR HENRY WOTTON AND MILTON.</h3>

  <p>The letter which sir Henry Wotton addressed to Milton, on receiving
  the <i>Maske presented at Ludlow-castle</i>, appears to admit of an
  interpretation which has escaped the numerous editors of the works of
  Milton; and I resolve to put this novel conjecture on its trial in the
  critical court of facts and inferences held at No. 186. Fleet Street.</p>

  <p>Sir Henry Wotton thus expresses himself on the circumstance which I
  conceive to have been misinterpreted:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For the work itself [a dainty piece of entertainment, by Milton] I
  had viewed some good while before with singular delight, having received
  it from our common friend Mr. R. in the very close of the late R.'s
  <i>Poems</i>, printed at Oxford; whereunto [it] is added (as I now
  suppose) that the accessory might help out the principal, according to
  the art of stationers, and to leave the reader <i>con la bocca
  dolce</i>."&mdash;<i>Reliquiæ Wottonianæ</i>, 1672.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the poems of Milton, as edited by himself in 1645, the date of this
  letter is "13th April, 1638;" and as the <i>Poems</i> of "Thomas
  Randolph, master of arts, and late fellow of Trinity colledge in
  Cambridge," were printed at Oxford in that year, in small quarto, it may
  be assumed that the gift of <i>Mr. R.</i> was a copy of that volume, with
  the addition of the <i>Maske</i>, as printed in the same size in 1637.
  Such was the conclusion of Warton, and such is mine. The question at
  issue is, Who was <i>Mr. R.</i>? Warton says, "I believe <i>Mr. R.</i> to
  be John Rouse," the keeper of the Bodleian library. Is it not more
  probable that <i>Mr. R.</i> means Robert Randolph, master of arts, and
  student of Christchurch&mdash;a younger brother of Thomas Randolph, and
  the editor of his poems?</p>

  <p>I must first dispose of the assertion that the friendship between
  Rouse and Milton "appears to have subsisted in 1637." There is no
  evidence of their friendship till 1647; and that evidence is the ode to
  Rouse, to which this address is prefixed: "Jan. 23. 1646. Ad Joannem
  Rousium, Oxoniensis academiæ bibliothecarium. De libro poematum amisso,
  <i>quem ille sibi denuo mitti postulabat</i>, ut cum aliis nostris in
  bibliotheca publica reponeret, ode." It seems that Milton did not send
  the volume of 1645 till a copy of it had been requested; no evidence,
  certainly, of old friendship! I admit the probability that Wotton and
  Rouse were friends; but why should Rouse <i>officiously stitch up</i>, as
  Warton expresses it, the <i>Mask</i> of Milton with the <i>Poems</i> of
  Thomas Randolph, and present the volume to Wotton? Did he give away that
  which is still wanting in the Bodleian library?</p>

  <p>Admit my novel conjecture, and all the difficulties vanish. Thomas
  Randolph, says Phillips, was "one of the most pregnant young wits of his
  time;" and Robert, who was also noted as a poet, could scarcely fail to
  offer the poems of his brother to so eminent a person as sir Henry
  Wotton. As sir Henry <i>yearly went to Oxford</i>, he may have made
  acquaintance with Robert; and Robert may have been introduced to Milton
  by Thomas, who was for eight years his cotemporary at Cambridge, and in
  the enjoyment of much more celebrity. The <i>Maske</i> may have been
  added as an experiment in criticism.</p>

  <p>The rev. Thomas Warton was a man of extensive reading, an excellent
  critic, and a fascinating writer&mdash;but too often inattentive to
  accuracy of statement. He says that Randolph <i>died</i> the 17th March,
  1634: Wood says he was <i>buried</i> the 17th March, 1634. He says it is
  so stated on his monument: the monument has no date. He says the
  <i>Poems</i> of Randolph contain 114 pages: the volume contains 368
  pages! He says the <i>Maske</i> is a slight quarto of 30 pages only; it
  contains 40 pages! Is it not fit that such carelessness should be
  exposed?</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Unlucky to sell eggs after Sunset.</i>&mdash;The following
  paragraph is extracted from the <i>Stamford Mercury</i> of October 29,
  1852:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There exists a species of superstition in north Nottinghamshire
  against letting eggs go out of a house after sunset. The other day a
  person in want of some eggs called at a farm-house in East Markham, and
  inquired of the good woman of the house whether she had any eggs to sell,
  to which she replied that she had a few scores to dispose of. 'Then I'll
  take them home <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span>with me in the cart,' was his answer; to which
  she somewhat indignantly replied, 'That you'll not; don't you know the
  sun has gone down? You are welcome to the eggs at a proper hour of the
  day; but I would not let them go out of the house after the sun is set on
  any consideration whatever!'"</p>

  <p><i>Legend of Change.</i>&mdash;In one of the Magazines for November, a

  visiting at distant intervals the same spot, finds it occupied by a city,
  an ocean, a forest, and a city again: the mortals whom he found there, on
  each occasion, believing that the present state had existed for ever. I
  have seen in the newspapers, at different times, a poem (or I rather
  think two poems) founded on this legend; and I should like to know the
  author or authors, and whether it, or either of them, is to be found in

<h3>PASSAGE IN HAMLET.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</p>
      <p>Unhousell'd, disappointed, unaneld'd."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Hamlet</i>, Act I. Sc. 5.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Boucher, in his <i>Glossary of Archaic and Provincial Words</i> (art.
  <span class="sc">Anyeal</span>), has a note on this passage which seems
  to me to give so much better an idea of the word <i>disappointed</i> than
  any I have met with, that I am induced to send it you as a
  Note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The last two words have occasioned considerable difficulty to the
  critics. The old copies, it is said, concur in giving
  <i>disappointed</i>, which Dr. Johnson is willing to understand as
  meaning <i>unprepared</i>; a sense that might very well suit the context,
  but will not be easily confirmed by any other instance of the use of the
  word <i>disappointed</i>. Dissatisfied, therefore, with this
  interpretation, some have read <i>unanointed</i>, and some
  <i>unappointed</i>. Not approving of either of these words, as connected
  with <i>unanealed</i>, Pope, no timid corrector of texts, reads
  <i>unaneld</i>, which he supposes to signify <i>unknelled</i>, or the
  having no knell rung. To these emendations and interpretations Mr.
  Theobald, whose merit as a commentator of Shakspeare Mr. Pope, with all
  his wit and all his poetry, could not bring into dispute, urged many
  strong objections. Skinner rightly explains <i>anealed</i> as meaning
  <i>unctus</i>; from the Teutonic preposition <i>an</i>, and <i>ele</i>,
  oil. As correction of the second word is admitted by all the commentators
  to be necessary, it is suggested that a clear and consistent meaning,
  consonant with Shakspeare's manner, will be given to the passage, if,
  instead of <i>disappointed</i>, <i>unassoiled</i>, which signifies
  'without absolution,' be substituted.</p>

  <p>"The line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Unhousell'd, unassoil'd, unaneal'd,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>will then signify 'without receiving the sacrament: without confession
  and absolution: and without extreme unction.'</p>

  <p>"The <i>unassoiled</i> was no less proper, will appear from due
  attention to the word <i>assoile</i>, which of course is derived from
  <i>absolvo</i>; and the transition from <i>absolve</i> into
  <i>assoyle</i> is demonstrated in the following passage from Piers
  Plowman, Vision, p. 3.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'There preached a pardoner, as he a priest were,</p>
      <p>Brought forth a bul, with many a bishop's seales,</p>
      <p>And saide, that himself might absoyle hem alle,</p>
      <p>Of falshode, of fasting, and of vowes broken.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As a further confirmation of the propriety of substituting a word
  signifying <i>absolution</i>, which pre-supposes confession, the
  following sentence from <i>Prince Arthur</i> may be adduced: 'She was
  confessed and houselled, and then she died,' part ii. p. 108.</p>

  <p>"It must be allowed that no instance can be given of the word
  <i>unassoiled</i>: but neither does any other instance occur to me of the
  word <i>unhouseled</i> except the line in <i>Hamlet</i>."</p>

<h3>VOLCANIC INFLUENCE ON THE WEATHER.</h3>

  <p>The recent observations of your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr.
  Noake</span> (Vol. vi., p. 531.) on the superstitions of the people of
  Worcestershire regarding the weather, have called my attention to the
  present extraordinary wet season, on which subject I have been asked many
  questions. Although I do not account myself any more weatherwise than my
  neighbours, yet I may note that, for many years past, I have remarked
  that whenever we have had any very serious volcanic disturbance in the
  Mediterranean or its neighbourhood, or at Mount Hecla, we have always had
  some corresponding atmospheric agitation in this country, either in
  excessive heat or moisture, or both, and accompanied with very
  perceptible vibrations, at times so strong as to answer the name of
  earthquakes; and these vibrating so generally in the direction from
  north-west to south-east, I have been convinced that underneath us there
  is a regular steam passage from Mount Hecla in Iceland to Mount Vesuvius
  in Italy. I have unfortunately mislaid my memoranda on this subject, and
  have no regular roster of these occasional visitations to refer to, but I
  think my attention to this effect was first impressed on me by the season
  which followed the destruction at Lisbon in 1796. I recollect a friend of
  mine, the late Mr. Empson, of Bouley, while attending some drainage
  improvements in his carrs within the Level of Ancholme, was aroused by an
  extraordinary noise, which he thought was occasioned by some "drunken
  fools," as he called them, racing with their waggons upon the turnpike
  road above the hill, which was two miles off from where he then was in
  the carrs. His uphill shepherd, however, told him, when he got home, that
  there had been no such occurrence as he supposed on the turnpike, as, had
  such been the case, he must have heard and seen it. The next day,
  however, added fresh information, and better observers discovered that
  the noise heard across the carrs was underground; and further
  intelligence confirmed the suspicion that it was occasioned by a species
  of earthquake that had been felt at different places with different
  intensities, through Yorkshire and Lancashire, and amongst the islands
  west of Scotland; and afterwards came the same kind of intelligence
  across France, confirming me in my conclusions before noted. And ever
  since this period of 1796 we have never had any extraordinary alternation
  of extreme heat or wet, without its being to me the result of some
  accompanying volcanic agitation in Mount Hecla, or Mount Vesuvius or its
  neighbourhood; and the recurrence of the violent ebullition that has this
  year being going on at Mount Etna may therefore be considered as the
  electric cause not only of the extraordinary heat of our late summer, but
  also of the floods that have subsequently poured down upon us. It is only
  of late years that scientific men have paid due attention to these
  physical phenomena. Sir Humphrey Davy, I think, was the first who laid
  down their causes; and if we recollect the account given by Sir Stamford
  Raffles of the appalling effects of the tremendous explosion of Tombora,
  in Sambowa, one of the islands east of Java, in the year 1815, described
  as so violent in its immediate neighbourhood as to cause men, and horses,
  and trees to be taken up into the air like chaff; and of its effects
  being perceptible in Sumatra, where, nearly at a thousand miles distance
  from it, they heard its thundering noisy explosions,&mdash;thinking of
  this, we may well accede the comparatively small vibrations that we
  occasionally feel, as arising from the interchange of civilities passing
  between our volcanic neighbours Hecla and Vesuvius, or Etna; and glad we
  may be that we have them in no more inconvenient shape or degree than we
  have hitherto experienced them. I have some friends in Lancashire who
  have been a good deal alarmed by the vibrations they have lately
  experienced; and I must confess that my good wife and myself were, on the
  morning of the 10th Dec., not a little startled in our bed by a shock
  that aroused us early to inquire after the cause of it, but for which we
  cannot account otherwise than that, from its sudden electric character,
  the Lancashire vibration had reached us. The chief purport, however, of
  my present communication is, to make inquiry amongst your readers,
  whether any of them, like myself, have observed and experienced any
  recurrence of these concomitant and physical obtrusions.</p>

<h3>EUSTACHE DE SAINT PIERRE.</h3>

  <p>With the siege of Calais, and its surrender to Edward III. in 1347, is
  associated the name of Eustache de St. Pierre, whose loyalty and
  devotedness have been immortalised by the historian, and commemorated by
  the artist's pencil. The subject of Queen Philippa's intercessions on
  behalf of Eustache and his brave companions is, no doubt, familiar to
  most of your readers: the stern demeanour of the king; the tears and
  supplicating attitude of the Queen Philippa; and the humiliating position
  of the burgesses of Calais, &amp;c. But what if Eustache de St. Pierre
  had been bought over by King Edward? For without going the length of
  pronouncing the scenes of the worthy citizens, with halters round their
  necks, to have been a "got up" affair, there is, however, some reason to
  doubt whether the boasted loyalty of Eustache de St. Pierre was such as
  is represented, as will appear from the following notes. And however much
  the statements therein contained may detract from the cherished popular
  notions regarding Eustache de St. Pierre, yet the seeker after truth is
  inexorable, or, to use the words of Sir Francis Palgrave (<i>Hist. of
  Norm. and Eng.</i>, i. 354.), he is expected "to uncramp or shatter the
  pedestals supporting the idols which have won the false worship of the
  multitude; so that they may nod in their niches, or topple down."</p>

  <p>In one of the volumes forming part of that valuable collection
  published by the French <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>{11}</span>government,and commenced, I believe, under
  the auspices of M. Guizot, namely, the <i>Documens inédits sur l'Histoire
  de France</i>, the following passage attracted my notice:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Il (M. de Bréquigny) a prouvé par des titres authentiques et inconnus
  jusqu'à présent, qu'Eustache de St. Pierre, dont on a si fort vanté le
  dévouement pour les habitans de Calais, fut séduit par Edouard, et qu'il
  reçut de ce prince des pensions et des possessions fort peu de temps
  après la prise de cette place, aux conditions d'y maintenir le bon ordre,
  et de la conserver à l'Angleterre."&mdash;See <i>Lettres de Rois,
  &amp;c.</i>, vol. i. Preface, p. cix.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above statement is founded on a memoir read before the Académie
  des Belles-Lettres by M. de Bréquigny, respecting the researches made by
  him in London (see <i>Mém. de l'Acad. des Belles-Lettres</i>, tom.
  xxxvii.).</p>

  <p>Lingard throws a doubt over the matter. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Froissart has dramatised this incident with considerable effect; but,
  I fear, with little attention to truth.... Even in Froissart there is
  nothing to prove that Edward designed to put these men to death. On the
  contrary, he takes notice that the King's refusal of mercy was
  accompanied with a wink to his attendants, which, if it meant anything,
  must have meant that he was not acting seriously."&mdash;<i>Lingard</i>,
  3rd edit. 1825, vol. iv. p. 79., note 85.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, in Hume:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The story of the six burgesses of Calais, like all extraordinary
  stories, is somewhat to be suspected; and so much the more, as Avesbury,
  who is particular in his narrative of the surrender of Calais, says
  nothing of it, and, on the contrary, extols in general the King's
  generosity and lenity to the inhabitants."&mdash;<i>Hume</i>, 8vo. 1807,
  vol. ii., note <span class="sm">H</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Both Hume and Lingard mention that Edward expelled the natives of
  Calais, and repeopled the place with Englishmen; but they say nothing as
  to Eustache de St. Pierre becoming a pensioner of the King's "aux
  conditions d'y maintenir le bon ordre, et de la conserver à
  l'Angleterre."</p>

  <p>Châteaubriand (<i>Etudes Hist.</i>, 1831, 8vo., tome iv. p. 104.)
  gives Froissart's narrative, by which he abides, at the same time
  complaining of the "esprit de dénigrement" which he says prevailed
  towards the end of the last century in regard to heroic actions.</p>

  <p>Regarding Queen Philippa's share in the transaction above referred to,
  M. de Bréquigny says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"La reine, qu'on suppose avoir été si touchée du malheur des six
  bourgeois dont elle venait de sauver la vie, ne laissa pas d'obtenir, peu
  de jours après, la confiscation des maisons que Jean d'Acre, l'un d'eux,
  avait possédées dans Calais."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Miss Strickland (<i>Lives of Queens</i>, 1st edit., vol. ii. p. 336.)
  likewise gives the story as related by Froissart, but mentions the fact
  of Queen Philippa taking possession of Jean d'Acre's property, and the
  doubt cast upon Eustache's loyalty; but she would appear to justify him
  by reason of King Philip's abandoning the brave Calaisiens to their fate.
  However this may be, documents exist proving that the inhabitants of
  Calais were indemnified for their losses: and whether or not the family
  of Eustache de St. Pierre approved his conduct, so much is certain, that,
  on the death of the latter, the property which had been granted to him by
  King Edward was confiscated, because they would not acknowledge their
  allegiance to the English.</p>

  <p>I wish to ask whether this new light thrown on the subject, through M.
  de Bréquigny's labours, has been hitherto noticed, for it would appear
  the story should be re-written.</p>

<h3>DEVIZES, ORIGIN OF: A QUESTION FOR THE HERALDS.</h3>

  <p>I will put the following case as briefly as I can.</p>

  <p>Throughout the mediæval ages, the word <i>devise</i> formed the
  generic term for every species of emblazonment. Thus we have "<i>Devises
  Heroiques</i>, per Claude Paradin, Lyons, 1557;" "<i>Devises et Emblems
  d'Amour moralisés</i>, par Flamen;" "<i>The Paradise of Dainty
  Devices</i>, 1576;" "<i>Minerva Britannica, or a Garden of Heroical
  Devices furnished and adorned with Emblems and Impressa's of Sundry
  Natives</i>, newly devised, moralised, and published by Henry Peachum,
  1612;" and lastly, Henry Estienne's "discourse of hieroglyphs, symbols,
  gryphs, emblems, enigmas, sentences, parables, reverses of medals, arms,
  blazons, cimiers, cyphers, and rebus," which learned discourse, be it
  observed, is entitled <i>The Art of making Devises</i>, 1646. As an
  additional proof that device included the motto, take the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Henry III. commanded to be written by way of device in his chamber at
  Woodstock, 'Qui non dat quod amat non accipit ille quod optat;'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>quoted by Sir Eger. Brydges. Here I must stop, though I could add many
  illustrations; and go on to observe, that whereas all the explanations
  which I have ever met with, of the unique appellation of "Castrum
  Divisarum," or the castle of Devises, are totally un-historic, if not
  ridiculous, I crave the attention of all whom it may concern to a new
  solution of the difficulty.</p>

  <p>First, then, in order to clear the way, I would observe, that if, as
  commonly stated, the name had signified a frontier fort, would it not
  have been called the castle of the division [singular] rather than the
  castle of the divided districts? In other words, why make it a plural
  term?</p>

  <p>Secondly. If, as I surmise, the Italian word <i>divisa</i> bore at the
  time of the Conquest its present meaning of "device," in greater force
  than the <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span>sense of divisions or partitions, is it
  unreasonable to suppose that Castrum Divisarum implied and constituted,
  at that early period, the deposit or fountain-head of the blazonry of the
  Norman leaders?</p>

  <p>It was certainly not unsuited for such a species of heralds' college;
  being central, inland, a royal treasury, and the frequent scene of a
  court. When in the ensuing age re-edified by Bishop Roger, the monkish
  historians, without a dissentient voice, proclaimed it the most splendid
  castle in the realm; and though it may be objected that this observation
  belongs to a date not to our purpose, yet the pre-existence of the
  fortress is proved by its having been the temporary prison of Duke
  Robert. I am aware that such a notion as Devizes having formed the
  nucleus of the tree heraldic in England is not countenanced, nor even
  suspected, by any of the popular writers on the art. I may add, that one
  gentleman, holding an important position therein, has signified his
  disapproval of so early an origin being assigned to the institution. But
  over-against this, I beg to parade a passage from a letter written by
  Thomas Blore in 1806 to Sir Egerton Brydges:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The heralds," says he, "seem originally not to have been instituted
  for the manufacturing of armorial ensigns, but for the recording those
  ensigns which had been borne."&mdash;<i>Censura Literaria</i>, vol. iii.
  p. 254.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My case is now stated. I shall be well content that some of your
  archæological friends should scatter it to the winds, provided they will
  explain how it is that Devizes, in common with some of the ancient cities
  of Egypt and Greece, has so long rejoiced in a plural name. To aid this
  last endeavour, I close with one more statement. The castle stood nearly
  midway between two other adjoining towns or villæ, also bearing plural
  names: Potternæ=arum [Posternæ?] and Kaningæ=arum.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Waylen.</span></p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;I think I may plead the privilege of a postscript for the
  purpose of recording (what may be taken as) an indication, though perhaps
  not a proof, that the idea of devices or contrivances was implied in the
  name so recently as the period of the civil war. The <i>Mercurius
  Civicus</i>, a parliamentary paper, 1644, states that Devizes was being
  garrisoned for the king, in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hopton is fortifying amain at the Devises in Wiltshire, but I fear
  greater fortifyings for the Devices in Oxford."</p>

  being a <i>cock</i>; it is of very pure metal, and weighs 155 grains. It
  is in fine preservation: and device is rudely cut, but I beg to inclose
  an impression from which you may judge. Can any of your antiquarian
  readers throw any light on the subject to whom this device originally
  belonged?</p>

  <p>In levelling the fortified entrenchment above referred to some half
  century ago, various utensils of pottery, burnt bones, spear and arrow
  heads, tesselated tiles, fragments of sculptured stones, and other relics
  of antiquity, were found.</p>

  <p><i>Ecclesia Anglicana.</i>&mdash;I observe, in an interesting letter
  published in the December Number of the <i>Ecclesiologist</i>, in an
  enumeration of Service Books belonging to the English Church before the
  Reformation, and now existing in the Pepysian Library, Cambridge, the
  following title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"No. 1198. Servicium de omni Officio Episcopali consernenta
  (<i>sic</i>) chorum ... secundum usum Ecclesie Anglicane."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now I am anxious to know from any of your readers, who are better
  informed on these subjects than I am, or who have access to old
  libraries, whether <i>Ecclesia Anglicana</i> is a <i>usual</i>
  designation of the Catholic Church in England before the Reformation.</p>

  <p>Service Books according to the use of some particular cathedral church
  are of course well known, as in this same list to which I have referred
  we find "secundum usum insignis ecclesie Eboracensis," "ad insignis
  ecclesiæ Sarisburiensis usum," &amp;c.: but I should be glad to learn, in
  these days of <i>ultramontane</i> pretensions, whether, even prior to the
  Reformation, the distinct nationality of the Anglican church was
  <i>commonly</i> asserted by the use of such a title in her Service Books.
  I need scarcely observe how many interesting cognate questions might be
  asked on this subject.</p>

  <p><i>Tangiers.&mdash;English Army in 1684.</i>&mdash;A merchant in 1709
  deposed that he knew not how long complainant had been a <i>soldier</i>,
  or beyond the seas before May, 1697, but that he has heretofore seen and
  knew him at Tomger, before and at the time of the demolishing thereof,
  being then a <i>soldier</i>; and no doubt could prove that he was in
  England a considerable time next before May, 1697.</p>

  <p>Could the place be other than Tangiers, destroyed in 1684?</p>

  <p>Was complainant (a younger son of a well-connected family of gentry,
  but himself probably in poverty), who in deeds, and on his mon. tablet,
  is described as gent., likely to have been in 1684 (aged twenty-seven) a
  private, a non-commissioned, or commissioned officer?</p>

  <p>If the latter, would he not have been so described?</p>

  <p><i>Etymological Traces of the Social Position of our
  Ancestors.</i>&mdash;I remember reading an account of the traces of the
  social position of our Saxon ancestors yet remaining in our English
  customs, which interested me much at the time, and which I would gladly
  again refer to, as, Captain Cuttle's invaluable maxim not being then
  extant, I neglected "making a note of it."</p>

  <p>It described the Norman derivation of the names of all kinds of
  <i>meat</i>, as beef, mutton, veal, venison, &amp;c.; while the
  corresponding <i>animals</i> still retained their original Saxon
  appellations, ox, sheep, calf, &amp;c.: and it accounted for this by the
  fact, that while the animals were under the care of the Saxon thralls and
  herdsmen, they retained of course their Saxon names; but when served up
  at the tables of their Norman lords, it became necessary to name them
  afresh.</p>

  <p>I think the word <i>heronsewes</i> (cf. Vol. iii., pp. 450. 207.; Vol.
  iv., p. 76.) is another example, which are called <i>harnseys</i> at this
  day in Norfolk; as it is difficult, on any other supposition, to account
  for an East-Anglian giving a French appellation to so common a bird as
  the heron.</p>

  the common hangman." Is this fact recorded in any Life of Locke; or how
  may it be ascertained? There is no notice of it, I believe, in either
  Law's <i>Life</i>, or in that of Lord King.</p>

  <p><i>The Burial Service said by Heart.</i>&mdash;Bishop Sprat (in his
  <i>Discourse to his Clergy</i>, 1695, for which see <i>Clergyman's
  Instructor</i>, 1827, p. 245.) relates that, immediately after the
  Restoration, a noted ringleader of schism in the former times was
  interred in one of the principal churches of London, and that the
  minister of the parish, being a wise and regular conformist, and
  afterwards an eminent bishop, delivered the whole Office of Burial by
  heart on that occasion. The friends of the deceased were greatly edified
  at first, but afterwards much surprised and confounded when they found
  that their fervent admiration had been bestowed on a portion of the
  Common Prayer. Southey (<i>Common-Place Book</i>, iii. 492.) conjectures
  that the minister was Bull. This cannot be, for Bull, I believe, never
  held a London cure. Was it Hackett? And who was the noted ringleader of
  schism?</p>

  <p><i>County History Societies.</i>&mdash;I would suggest the idea
  whether County History Societies might not be formed with advantage, as
  there are so many counties which have never had their histories written.
  They are very expensive and laborious for individuals to undertake, and
  constantly require additions on account of the many changes which are
  taking place, to make them complete as works of reference for the present
  time: I think that by the means suggested they might be made very useful,
  particularly if complete statistical tables were annexed to the general
  and descriptive account. With comparatively little expense, the history
  and statistics of every county could be brought down to the latest date,
  making a valuable work of reference to which all could refer with
  confidence for the information which is constantly being sought for.</p>

  edition of Chatterton's <i>Works</i>, p. lxx.), says: "Chatterton, as
  appears by the coroner's inquest, swallowed arsenick in water, on the
  24th of August, 1770, and died in consequence thereof the next day."</p>

  <p>Mr. Barrett, the historian of Bristol, one of Chatterton's best
  friends and patrons, who, from his profession as a surgeon, was likely to
  have made, and seems to have made, inquiries as to the circumstances of
  his death, says, in his <i>History of Bristol</i>, not published before
  1789, and therefore not misled by any false first report, that
  Chatterton's principles impelled him to become his own executioner. He
  took a large dose of opium, some of which was picked out from his teeth
  after his death, and he was found the next morning a most horrid
  spectacle: with limbs and features distorted as after convulsions, a
  frightful and ghastly corpse" (p. 647.). I do not know whether this
  contradiction has ever been noticed, and shall be obliged to any
  correspondent who can give me information. I believe that Sir Herbert

  <p><i>Passage in Job.</i>&mdash;The wonderful and sublime book of Job,

  immortality were especially reserved as the glorious gift and revelation
  of our Blessed Redeemer, the eternal Author and Finisher of our
  salvation, yet Job was permitted to declare his deep conviction, that he
  should rise from the dead and see God. This memorable declaration (chap.
  xix. ver. 25.) can be forgotten by none of your readers; but some of them
  may not know that the Septuagint adds these words of life to chap. xlii.

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Edward the Confessor's Rings.</i>&mdash;There is an old legend of a
  ring given to one of our early kings, I think Edward the Confessor, by
  some saintly or angelic messenger. If any of your readers could give me
  any of the details of this story, it would very much oblige your constant
  reader</p>

  <p class="author">M. J. T.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The following extract from Taylor's <i>Glory of Regality</i>, pp. 74.
  <i>et seq.</i>, will give our Correspondent the legend referred to.</p>

  <p>"The ring with which our kings are invested, called by some writers
  'the wedding ring of England,' is illustrated, like the Ampulla, by a
  miraculous history, of which the following are the leading particulars:
  from the 'Golden Legende' (<i>Julyan Notary</i>, 1503), p.
  187.:&mdash;'Edward the Confessor being one day askt for alms by a
  certain 'fayre olde man,' the king found nothing to give him except his
  ring, with which the poor man thankfully departed. Some time after, two
  English pilgrims in the Holy Land having lost their road, as they
  travelled at the close of the day, 'there came to them a fayre auncyent
  man wyth whyte heer for age.' Then the old man axed them what they were
  and of what regyon. And they answerde that they were Pylgryms of Englond,
  and hadde lost their felyshyp and way also. Then this old man comforted
  theym goodly, and brought theym into a fayre cytee; and whan they had
  well refresshyd them, and rested theym alle nyght; on the morne, this
  fayre olde man wente with theym and brought theym in the ryght waye

  <p>"This command, as may be supposed, was punctually obeyed by the
  messengers, who were furnisht with ample powers for authenticating their
  mission. The ring was received by the Royal Confessor, and in after times
  was preserved with due care at his shrine in the Abbey of
  Westminster."]</p>

<h3>EMBLEMS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 460.)</p>

  <p>The Query confirms Professor De Morgan's excellent article in <i>The
  Companion to the Almanack for 1853</i>, "On the Difficulty of correct
  Description of Books." The manuscript note cited by H. J., though
  curiously inaccurate, guided me to the book for which he inquires. I copy
  the title-page: "<i>Die Betrübte Pegnesis, den Leben, Kunst, und
  Tugend-Wandel des Seelig-Edeln Floridans, H. Sigm. von Birken, Com. Pal.
  Cæs. durch 24 Sinnbilder in Kupfern, zur schuldigen nach-Ehre
  fürstellend, und mit Gesprach und Reim-Gedichten erklärend, durch ihre
  Blumen-Hirten.</i> Nürnberg, 1684, 12mo." I presume the annotator, not
  understanding German, and seeing "Floridans" the most conspicuous word on
  the title-page, cited him as the author; but it is the pastoral academic
  name of the late Herr Sigmond von Birken, in whose honour the work is
  composed. The emblem, with the motto "Bis fracta relinquor," at p. 249.
  (not 240.), is a tree from which two boughs are broken. It illustrates
  the death of Floridan's second wife, and his determination not to take a
  third. The chess-board, plate xiv. p. 202., has the motto, "Per tot
  discrimina rerum," and commemorates Floridan's safe return to Nuremberg
  after the multitudinous perils ("die Schaaren der Gefahren") of a journey
  through Lower Saxony. They must have been great, if typified by the state
  of the board, on which only a black king and a white bishop are
  left&mdash;a chess problem!</p>

  <p>I bought my copy at a book-sale many years ago, and, after reading a
  few pages, laid it aside as insufferably dull, although it was marked by
  its former possessor, the Rev. Henry White, of Lichfield, "Very rare,
  probably unique." On taking it up to answer H. J.'s Query, I found some
  matter relating to the German academies of the seventeenth century, which
  I think may be interesting.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hallam (<i>Literature of Europe</i>, <span class="sm">IV.</span>
  v. 9.) says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Arcadians determined to assume every one a pastoral name and a
  Greek birthplace; to hold their meetings in some verdant meadow, and to
  mingle with all their own compositions, as far as possible, images from
  pastoral life; images always agreeable, because they recall the times of
  primitive innocence. The poetical tribe adopted as their device the pipe
  of seven reeds bound with laurel, and their president, or director, was
  denominated General Shepherd or Keeper&mdash;<i>Custode
  Generale</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He slightly mentions the German academics of the sixteenth century
  (<span class="sm">III.</span> ix. 30.), and says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is probable that religious animosities stood in the way of such
  institutions, <i>or they may have flourished without obtaining much
  celebrity</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The academy of Pegnitz-shepherds ("Pegnitzshäfer-orden") took its name
  from the little river Pegnitz which runs through Nuremberg. Herr Sigmond
  von Birken was elected a member in 1645. He chose <i>Floridan</i> as his
  pastoral name, and the amaranth as his flower. In 1658 he was admitted to
  the Palm Academy ("Palmen-orden"), choosing the name <i>Der Erwacsene</i>
  (the adult?), and the snowdrop. In 1659, a vacancy having occurred in the
  Pegnitz-Herdsmen ("Pegnitz-Hirten") he was thought worthy to fill it, and
  in 1679 he received the diploma of the Venetian order of the Recuperati.
  He died in 1681. This, and what can be hung upon it, is <i>Die Betrübte
  Pegnitz</i>, a dialogue of 406 pages. It opens with a meeting of
  shepherds and shepherdesses, who go in and out of their cottages on the
  banks of the Pegnitz, and tell one another, what all seem equally well
  acquainted with, the entire life of their deceased friend. It would not
  be easy to find a work more clumsy in conception and tasteless in
  execution. Herr von Birken seems to have been a prosperous man, and to
  have enjoyed a high pastoral reputation. His works are enumerated, but
  the catalogue looks ephemeral. There is, however, one with a promising
  title: <i>Die Trockene Trunkenheit, oder die Gebrauch und Missbrauch des
  Tabacks</i>. His portrait, as "Der Erwachsene," is prefixed. It has not a
  shepherd-like look. He seems about fifty, with a fat face, laced cravat,
  and large flowing wig. There are twenty-four emblematical plates, rather
  below the average of their time.</p>

  <p>As so secondary a town as Nuremberg had at least three academies, we
  may infer that such <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>institutions were abundant in Germany, in
  the seventeenth century: that of the Pegnitz shepherds lasted at least
  till the beginning of the eighteenth. In <i>Der Thörichte
  Pritschmeister</i>, a comedy printed at Coblenz, 1704, one of the
  characters is "Phantasirende, ein Pegnitz Schäffer," who talks fustian
  and is made ridiculous throughout. The comedy is "von Menantes." I have
  another work by the same author: <i>Galante, Verliebte, und Satyrische
  Gedichte</i>, Hamburg, 1704. I shall be very glad to be told who he was,
  as his versification is often very good, and his jokes, though not
  graceful, and not very laughable, are real.</p>

<h3>MARRIAGES EN CHEMISE.&mdash;MANTELKINDER.&mdash;LEGITIMATION.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 485. 561.)</p>

  <p>The popular error on the legal effect of marriage <i>en chemise</i>
  is, I think, noticed among other vulgar errors in law in a little book
  published some twenty years ago under the name of <i>Westminster
  Hall</i>, to which a deceased lawyer of eminence, then young at the bar,
  was a contributor. I believe the opinion to be still extensively
  prevalent, and to be probably founded, not exactly in total ignorance,
  but in a misconception, of the law. The text writers inform us that "the
  husband is liable for the wife's debts, <i>because</i> he acquires an
  absolute interest in the personal estate of the wife," &amp;c. (Bacon's
  <i>Abridgment</i>, tit. "Baron and Feme.") Now an unlearned person, who
  hears this doctrine, might reasonably conclude, that if his bride has no
  estate at all, he will incur no liability; and the future husband, more
  prudent than refined, might think it as well to notify to his neighbours,
  by an unequivocal symbol, that he took no pecuniary benefit with his
  wife, and therefore expected to be free from her pecuniary burdens. In
  this, as in most other popular errors, there is found a <i>substratum</i>
  of reason.</p>

  <p>With regard to the other vulgar error, noticed at the foot of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Brooks'</span> communication (p. 561.), that "all children
  under the girdle at the time of marriage are legitimate," the origin of
  it is more obvious. Every one knows of the "legitimatio per subsequens
  matrimonium" of the canonists, and how the barons assembled in parliament
  at Merton refused to engraft this law of the Church on the jurisprudence
  of England. But it is not perhaps so well known that, upon such a
  marriage the premature offspring of the bride and bridegroom sometimes
  used to perform a part in the ceremony, and received the nuptial
  benediction under the veil or mantle of the bride or the pallium of the
  altar. Hence the children so legitimated are said to have been called by
  the Germans <i>Mantelkinder</i>. The learning on this head is to be found
  in Hommel's <i>Jurisprudentia Numismatibus Illustrata</i> (Lipsiæ, 1763),
  pp. 214-218., where the reader will also find a pictorial illustration of
  the ceremony from a codex of the <i>Novellæ</i> in the library of
  Christian Schwarz. The practice seems to have been borrowed from the form
  of adopting children, noticed in the same work and in Ducange, verb.
  "Pallium, <i>Pallio cooperire</i>;" and in Grimm's <i>Deut. Rechts
  Alterth.</i>, p. 465.</p>

  <p>Let me add a word on the famous negative given to the demand of the
  clergy at Merton. No reason was assigned, or, at least, has been
  recorded, but a general unwillingness to change the laws of England. As
  the same barons did in fact consent to change them in other particulars,
  this can hardly have been the reason. Sir W. Blackstone speaks of the
  consequent uncertainty of heirship and discouragement of matrimony as
  among the causes of rejection,&mdash;arguments of very questionable
  weight. Others (as Bishop Hurd, in his <i>Dialogues</i>) have attributed
  the rejection to the constitutional repugnance of the barons to the
  general principles of the canon and imperial law, which the proposed
  change might have tended to introduce,&mdash;a degree of forethought and
  a range of political vision for which I can hardly give them credit,
  especially as the great legal authority of that day, Bracton, has
  borrowed the best part of his celebrated Treatise from the Corpus Juris.
  The most plausible motive which I have yet heard assigned for this famous
  parliamentary negative on the bishops' bill at Merton, is suggested (quod
  minimè reris!) in an Assistant Poor-Law Commissioner's Report (vol. vi.
  of the 8vo. printed series), viz. that bastardy multiplied the escheats
  which accrued to medieval lords of manors.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">E. Smirke.</span></p>

  <p>A venerable person whose mind is richly stored with "shreds and
  patches" of folk-lore and local antiquities, on seeing the "curious
  marriage entry" (p. 485.), has furnished me with the following
  explanation.</p>

  <p>It is the popular belief at Kirton in Lindsey that if a woman, who has
  contracted debts previous to her marriage, leave her residence in a state
  of nudity, and go to that of her future husband, he the husband will not
  be liable for any such debts.</p>

  <p>A case of this kind actually occurred in that highly civilised town
  within my informant's memory; the woman leaving her house from a bedroom
  window, and putting on some clothes as she stood on the top of the ladder
  by which she accomplished her descent.</p>

  <p class="author">K. P. D. E.</p>

  <p>In that amusing work, Burn's <i>History of the Fleet Marriages</i>, p.
  77., occurs the following entry:&mdash;"The woman ran across Ludgate Hill
  in her shift;" to which the editor has added this note:&mdash;"The
  <i>Daily Journal</i> of 8th November, 1725, mentions a similar exhibition
  at Ulcomb in <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>Kent. It was a vulgar error that a man was
  not liable to the bride's debts, if he took her in no other apparel than
  her shift."</p>

  <p>The <i>first</i> of these, which is the first book printed in Ireland,
  is extremely rare. I believe only two copies are certainly known to

  other in that of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Both are in very fine
  condition.</p>

  <p>The <i>second</i> is in my possession. The book is quite perfect; but
  some wiseacre has carefully erased the date. The <i>Almanac for xxvi
  Yeares</i> tells nothing, being for the years 1603 to 1628. But the book
  contains a prayer for "Frederick, the Prince Elector Palatine, and the
  Lady Elizabeth, his wife, with their hopeful issue." He married the
  princess in 1613; and in 1619 he was elected King of Bohemia, and
  thenceforward would be prayed for under his higher title. If the Sunday
  letter in the calendar is to be trusted, the book was printed (according
  to De Morgan's <i>Book of Almanacs</i>) in 1617. The Dublin Society of
  Stationers was established in that year; and it is not unlikely that they
  commenced their issues with a Prayer-Book. I have never seen nor heard of
  another copy, with which I might compare mine, and thus ascertain its
  date.</p>

  <p>The <i>third</i>, of 1637, is reported; but I have never met with
  it.</p>

<h3>ETYMOLOGY OF PEARL.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 578.)</p>

  <p>The inquiry of your correspondent <span class="sc">Ifigfowl</span>
  respecting the etymology of the word <i>pearl</i> does not admit of a
  simple answer. The word occurs in all the modern languages, both Romance
  and Teutonic: <i>perla</i>, Ital. and Span.; <i>perle</i>, French and
  German, whence the English <i>pearl</i>. Adelung in v. believes the word
  to be of Teutonic origin, and considers it as the diminutive of
  <i>beere</i>, a berry. Others derive it from <i>perna</i>, the Latin name
  of a shell-fish (see Ducange in <i>perlæ</i>; Diez, <i>Grammatik der
  Romanischen Sprachen</i>, vol. i. p. 235.). Neither of these derivations
  is probable: it is not shown that <i>beere</i> had a diminutive form, and
  <i>perna</i> was a local and obscure name: see Pliny, <i>N. H.</i> xxxii.
  ad fin. Salmasius (<i>Exercit. Plin.</i>, p. 40. ed. 1689) thinks that
  <i>perla</i> is formed from <i>perula</i>, for <i>sperula</i>, the
  diminutive of <i>sphæra</i>. A more probable origin is that the word is
  formed from the Latin <i>pirum</i>, as suggested by Diez, in allusion to
  the pear-shaped form of the pearl. Ducange in v. says that the extremity
  of the nose was called <i>pirula nasi</i>, from its resemblance to the
  form of a pear. But <i>pirus</i> was used to denote a boundary-stone,
  made in a pyramidal shape (Ducange in v.); and this seems to have been
  the origin of the singular expression <i>pirula nasi</i>, as being
  something at the extremity. Another supposition is, that the word
  <i>perla</i> is derived from the Latin <i>perula</i>, the diminutive of
  <i>pera</i>, a wallet. A wallet was a small bag hung round the neck; and
  the word <i>perula</i>, in the sense of a small bag, occurs in Seneca and
  Apuleius. The analogy of shape and mode of wearing is sufficiently close
  to suggest the transfer of the name. <i>Perula</i> and <i>perulus</i> are
  used in Low Latin in the sense of <i>pearl</i>. Ducange cites a passage
  from a hagiographer, where <i>perula</i> means the white of the eye,
  evidently alluding to the colour of the pearl.</p>

  <p>The choice seems to lie between <i>perula</i> as the diminutive of
  <i>pera</i> or of <i>pirum</i>. Neither derivation is improbable. It is
  to be observed that the modern Italian form of <i>pirum</i>, the fruit of
  the pear, is <i>pera</i>; the modern feminine noun being, as in numerous
  other cases, formed from the plural of the Latin neuter noun (see Diez,
  ib. vol. ii. p. 19.). The analogy of <i>unio</i> (to which I shall <!--
  Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>advert
  presently) supports the derivation from the fruit; the derivation from
  <i>pera</i>, a wallet, is, on merely linguistical grounds,
  preferable.</p>

  <p>The Greek name of <i>pearl</i> is <span title="margaritês" class="grk"
  >&mu;&alpha;&rho;&gamma;&alpha;&rho;&#x1F77;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>,
  originally applied to a precious stone, and apparently moulded out of
  some oriental name, into a form suited to the Greek pronunciation. Scott
  and Liddell in v. derive it from the Persian <i>murwari</i>. Pliny, <i>H.
  N.</i> ix. 56., speaking of the pearl, says: "Apud Græcos non est, ne
  apud barbaros quidem inventores ejus, aliud quam margaritæ." The Greek
  name <i>Margarita</i> was used by the Romans, but the proper Latin name
  for the pearl was <i>unio</i>. Pliny (ibid.) explains this word by saying
  that each pearl is <i>unique</i>, and unlike every other pearl. Ammianus
  Marcellinus (lib. xxiii. ad fin.) thinks that pearls were called
  <i>uniones</i>, because the best were found single in the shell; Solinus
  (c. 53.) because they were always found single. The more homely
  explanation of Salmasius seems, however, to be the true one; namely, that
  the common word for an onion, growing in a single bulb, was transferred
  to the pearl (<i>Exercit. Plin.</i>, pp. 822-4.; Columella <i>de R.
  R.</i> xii. 10.). The ancient meaning of <i>unio</i> is still preserved
  in the French <i>ognon</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">L.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent asks the "etymon of our English word <i>pearl</i>."
  It would not be uninteresting to learn, at the same time, at what period
  <i>pearl</i> came into general use as an English word? Burton, who wrote
  his <i>Anatomy</i> in the reign of James I., uses the word <i>union</i>
  (from the Latin <i>unio</i>) instead of <i>pearl</i> (<i>Anat.
  Melanc.</i>, vol. ii. part 2. sec. 3. mem. 3., and ib., p. 2. sec. 4.
  mem. 1. subs. 4.). In the latter passage he says "Those smaller unions
  which are found in shells, amongst the Persians and Indians, are very
  cordial, and most part avail to the exhilaration of the heart."</p>

  <p>The Latin term <i>unio</i> differs from "margarita," in so far as it
  seems to have been applied by Pliny to distinguish the small and
  ill-shaped pearls, from the large round and perfect, which he calls
  "margaritæ." And in his ninth book, c. 59., he defines the difference
  philologically, as well as philosophically. Philemon Holland, who
  published his translation of Pliny in 1634, about thirteen years after
  Burton published the first edition of his <i>Anatomy</i>, uses the word
  <i>pearl</i> indifferently as the equivalent both of <i>margarita</i> and
  <i>unio</i>.</p>

  <p>Query: Was the word <i>union</i> generally received in England instead
  of <i>pearl</i> in Burton's time, and when did it give place to it?</p>

<h3>GÖTHE'S REPLY TO NICOLAI.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 434.).</p>

  <p>Had M. M. E. gone to the fountain-head, and consulted Göthe's own
  statement in his autobiography, he would have seen in the <i>Werke</i>,
  vol. xxvi. <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>p. 229., that Mr. Hayward's note was not
  written with that writer's usual care. Göthe does not say that his reply
  to Nicolai's <i>Joys of Werter</i>, though circulated only in MS.,
  destroyed N.'s literary reputation: on the contrary, he says that his
  squib (for it was no more) consisted of an epigram, not fit for
  communication, and a dialogue between Charlotte and Werter, which was
  never copied, and long lost; but that this dialogue, exposing N.'s
  impertinence, was written with a foreboding of his sad habit, afterwards
  developed, of treating of subjects out of his depth, which habit,
  notwithstanding his indisputable merits of another kind, utterly
  destroyed his reputation. This was most true: and yet all such assertions
  must be taken in a qualified sense. Nearly thirty years after this was
  written I partook of the hospitality of N. at Berlin. It was in 1803,
  when he was at the head, not of the Berlin literati, but of the
  book-manufactory of Prussia. He was then what, afterwards and elsewhere,
  the Longmans, Murrays, Constables, Cottas, and Brockhauses
  were,&mdash;the great publisher of his age and country. The
  <i>entrepreneur</i> of the <i>Neue Deutsche Bibliothek</i> may be
  compared with the publishers of our and the French great Cyclopædias, and
  our Quarterly Reviews.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate for the posthumous reputation of the great
  bibliopolist that he, patronising a school that was dying out, made war
  on the athletes of the rising school. He assailed nearly every great man,
  philosopher or poet, from Kant and Göthe downwards, especially of the
  schools of Saxony, Swabia, and the free imperial cities. No wonder that
  he became afterwards what Macfleckno and Colly Cibber had been to Dryden
  and Pope. In some dozen of the <i>Xenien</i> of Göthe and Schiller, in
  1797, he was treated as the Arch-Philistine.</p>

  <p>M. M. E. characterises him as the "friend" and "fellow-labourer" of
  Lessing. Now Lessing was incomparably the most eminent <i>littérateur</i>
  of the earlier part of that age,&mdash;the man who was the forerunner of
  the philosophers, and whose criticisms supplied the place of poetry. The
  satirists of the <i>Xenien</i> affect to compassionate Lessing, in having
  to endure a companion so forced on him as Nicolai was, whom they speak of
  as a "thorn in the crown of the martyr." The few who care for the
  literary controversies of the age of Göthe in Germany will be greatly
  assisted by an edition of the <i>Xenien</i>, with notes, published at
  Dantzig, 1833.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Processes upon Paper.</i>&mdash;The favourable manner in which the
  account I have given of the Collodion process has been received, not only
  by your readers in general, as has been evinced by many private letters,
  but also by the numerous correspondents it has drawn forth, induces me,
  after some little delay, to request space for a description of the
  following processes upon paper. In giving these I wish it to be
  understood that I may offer but little that is original, my object being
  to describe, as plainly as I possibly can, these easy methods, and to
  make no observation but what I have found to be successful in my own
  hands. I have had the good fortune to obtain the friendship of some of
  the most successful photographers of the day; and taking three very
  eminent ones, I find they have each some peculiarities in his mode of
  manipulation, varying with each other in the strength of the solutions
  employed, and producing results the most agreeable to their respective
  tastes. Reviewing these different processes in my own mind, and trying
  with patience the various results, I conclude that the following
  quantities are calculated to produce an adequate degree of sensibility in
  the paper, and yet to allow it to be prepared for the action of light for
  many hours previous to its use, and yet with more certainty than any
  other I am acquainted with. I think I may always depend upon it for
  twenty-four to thirty-six hours after excitement, and I have seen good
  pictures produced upon the third day. I believe it is a rule which admits
  of no contradiction, that the more you dilute your solution, the longer
  the excited paper will keep; but in proportion to its diminished
  sensibility, the time of exposure must be prolonged, and therefore I am,
  from this waste of time and other reasons, disposed to place much less
  value upon the wax-paper process than many do.</p>

  <p>The process I am about to describe is so simple, and I hope to make it
  so intelligible to your non-photographic readers, that a perfect novice,
  using ordinary care, must meet with success; but should I fail doing so
  upon all points, any information sought through the medium of "N. &amp;
  Q." shall meet with explanation from myself, if not from other of your
  experienced correspondents, whose indulgence I must beg should the
  communication be deemed too elementary, it being my earnest desire to
  point out to archæologists who are desirous of acquiring this knowledge,
  how easily they themselves may practise this beautiful art, and possess
  those objects they would desire to preserve, in a far more truthful state
  than could be otherwise accomplished.</p>

  <p>I have not myself met that uniform success with any other paper that I
  have with Turner's photographic of Chafford Mills: a sheet of this
  divided into two portions forms at the same time a useful and also a very
  easily-managed size, one adapted for most cameras, forming a picture of
  nine inches by seven, which is adequate for nearly every purpose. Each
  sheet being marked in its opposite corners with a plain pencil-mark on
  its smooth side (vide <i>antè</i>, p. 372.), the surface for <!-- Page 21
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>all future
  operations is in all lights easily discerned. In my instructions for
  printing from collodion negatives, a form of iodized paper was given,
  which, although very good, is not, I think, equal to the following, which
  is more easily and quickly prepared, exhibits a saving of the iodide of
  potassium, and is upon the whole a neater mode.</p>

  <p>Take sixty grains of nitrate of silver and sixty grains of iodide of
  potassium; dissolve each separately in an ounce of distilled water; mix
  together and stir with a glass rod. The precipitate settling, the fluid
  is to be poured away; then add distilled water to the precipitate up to
  four ounces, and add to it 650 grains of iodide of potassium, which
  <i>should</i> re-dissolve the precipitated iodide of silver, and form a
  perfectly clear solution; but if not, a little more must be carefully
  added, for this salt varies much, and I have found it to require 720
  grains to accomplish the desired object.</p>

  <p>The fluid being put into a porcelain or glass dish, the paper should
  be laid down upon its surface and immediately removed, and being laid
  upon a piece of blotting-paper with the wet surface uppermost, a glass
  rod then passed over it to and fro ensures the <i>total expulsion</i> of
  all particles of air, which will frequently remain when the mere dipping
  is resorted to. When dry, this paper should be soaked in common water for
  three hours, changing the water twice or thrice, so as to remove all the
  soluble salts. It should then be pinned up to dry, and, when so, kept in
  a folio for use. I have in this manner prepared from sixty to eighty
  sheets in an evening with the greatest ease. It keeps good for an
  indefinite time, and, as all experienced photographers are aware, unless
  you possess good iodized paper, which should be of a <i>primrose</i>
  colour, you cannot meet with success in your after-operations. Iodized
  paper becomes sometimes of a bright brimstone colour when first made; it
  is then very apt to brown in its use, but tones down and improves by a
  little keeping.</p>

  <p>To excite this paper, dissolve thirty grains of nitrate of silver in
  one ounce of distilled water, and add a drachm and a half of glacial
  acetic acid; of this solution take one drachm, <span class="correction" title="Omitted in original, insered by erratum in Issue 168."
  >and one drachm of saturated solution of gallic acid,</span> and add to
  it two ounces and a half of distilled water. The iodized surface of the
  paper may then be either floated on the surface of the aceto-nitrate of
  silver or exciting fluid, and afterwards a rod passed over, as was
  formerly done in the iodizing, or the aceto-nitrate may be applied evenly
  with a brush; but in either instance the surface should be immediately
  blotted off; and the same blotting-paper never used a second time for
  this, although it may be kept to develop on and for other purposes. It
  will be scarcely needful to observe that this process of exciting must be
  performed by the light of a candle or feeble yellow light, as must the
  subsequent development. The excited paper may be now placed for use
  between sheets of blotting-paper; it seems to act equally well either
  when damp or when kept for many hours, and I have found it good for more
  than a week.</p>

  <p>The time for exposure must entirely depend upon the degree of light.
  In two minutes and a half a good picture may be produced; but if left
  exposed for twenty minutes or more, little harm will arise; the paper
  does not <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'solarise', corrected by erratum in Issue 168."
  >solarize</span>, but upon the degree of image visible upon the paper
  depends the means of developing. When long exposed, a <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'solvent', corrected by erratum in Issue 168."
  >saturated</span> solution of gallic acid only applied to the exposed
  surfaces will be sufficient; but if there is little appearance of an
  image, then a free undiluted solution of aceto-nitrate may be used, in
  conjunction with the gallic acid, the former never being in proportion
  more than one-third. If that quantity is exceeded, either a brownish or
  an unpleasant reddish tint is often obtained. These negatives should be
  fixed by immersing them in a solution of <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'hyposulphate', corrected by erratum in Issue 168."
  >hyposulphite</span> of soda, which may be of the strength of one ounce
  of salt to eight ounces of water&mdash;the sufficiency of immersion being
  known by the disappearance of the yellow colour, and when they have been
  once immersed they may be taken to the daylight to ascertain this. The
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'hyposulphate', corrected by erratum in Issue 168."
  >hyposulphite</span> must now be perfectly removed by soaking in water,
  which may extend to several hours; but this may be always ascertained by
  the tongue, for, if tasteless, it has been accomplished. If it is deemed
  advisable&mdash;which I think is only required in very dark over-done
  pictures&mdash;to wax the negative, it is easily managed by holding a
  piece of white wax or candle in front of a clean iron rather hot, and
  passing it frequently over the surface. The superabundant wax being again
  removed by passing it between some clean pieces of blotting-paper.
  Although the minuter details can never be acquired by this mode which are
  obtained by the collodion process, it has the advantage of extreme
  simplicity, and by the operator providing himself with a bag or square of
  yellow calico, which he can loosely peg down to the ground when no other
  shade is near, to contain spare prepared papers, he can at any future
  time obtain a sufficient number of views, which afterwards he can develop
  at his leisure.</p>

  <p>It requires no liquids to be carried about with you, nor is that nice
  manipulation required which attends the collodion process.</p>

  <p>The wax-paper process has been extolled by many, and very successful
  results have been obtained: the paper has the undoubted advantage of
  keeping after being excited much longer than any other; but, from my own
  experience, just so much the weaker it is made, and so as to safely rely
  upon its long remaining useful, so it is proportionally slower in its
  action. And I have rarely seen from <!-- Page 22 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span>wax negatives positives
  so satisfactory in depth of tone, as from those which have been waxed
  after being taken on ordinary paper. It is all very well for gentlemen to
  advocate a sort of photographic tour, upon which you are to go on taking
  views day after day, and when you return home at leisure to develop your
  past proceedings: I never yet knew one so lukewarm in this pursuit as not
  to desire to know, at his <i>earliest possible</i> opportunity, the
  result of his labours; indeed, were not this the case, I fear
  disappointment would more often result than at present, for I scarcely
  think any one can exactly decide upon the power of the light of any given
  day, without having made some little trial to guide him. I have myself,
  especially with collodion, found the action very rapid upon some
  <i>apparently</i> dull day; whilst, from an unexplained cause, a
  comparatively brighter day has been less active in its photographic
  results. As in the previous process, I would strongly advise Turner's
  paper to be used, and not the thin French papers generally adopted,
  because I find all the high lights so much better preserved in the
  English paper. It may be purchased ready waxed nearly as cheap as it may
  be done by one's self; but as many operators like to possess that which
  is entirely their own production, the following mode will be found a
  ready way of waxing:&mdash;Procure a piece of thick smooth slate, a
  trifle larger than the paper to be used; waste pieces of this description
  are always occurring at the slate works, and are of a trifling value.
  This should be made very hot by laying it close before a fire; then,
  covered with one layer of thick blotting-paper, it will form a most
  admirable surface upon which to use the iron. Taking a piece of wax in
  the left hand, an iron well heated being pressed against it, it may
  rapidly be made to flow over the whole surface with much evenness, the
  surplus wax being afterwards removed by ironing between blotting-paper.
  When good, it should be colourless, free from gloss, and having the
  beautiful semi-transparent appearance of the Chinese rice-paper. To
  iodize the paper completely, immerse it in the following solution:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td style="width:10em"> Iodide of potash</td>
<td style="width:7em"> 200 grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Mannite</td>
<td> <span class="hid">00</span>6 drachms.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Cyanide of potash</td>
<td> <span class="hid">00</span>5 grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Distilled water</td>
<td> <span class="hid">0</span>20 ounces.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Allow it to remain three hours, taking care that air-particles are
  perfectly excluded, and once during the time turning over each sheet of
  paper, as many being inserted as the fluid will conveniently cover, as it
  is not injured by after keeping. It should be then removed from the
  iodide bath, pinned up, and dried, ready for use. When required to be
  excited, the paper should, by the light of a candle, be immersed in the
  following solution, where it should remain for five minutes:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td style="width:10em"> Nitrate of silver</td>
<td style="width:7em"> <span class="hid">00</span>4 drachms.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Glacial acetic acid</td>
<td> <span class="hid">00</span>4 drachms.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Distilled water</td>
<td> <span class="hid">00</span>8 ounces.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Being removed from the aceto-nitrate bath, immerse it into a pan of
  distilled water, where let it remain about a quarter of an hour. In order
  to make this paper keep a week or two, it must be immersed in a second
  water, which in point of fact is a mere reduction of the strength of the
  solutions already used; but for ordinary purposes, and when the paper is
  to be used within three or four days, one immersion is quite sufficient,
  especially as it does not reduce its sensitiveness in a needless way. It
  may now be preserved between blotting-paper, free from light, for future
  use. The time of exposure requisite for this paper will exceed that of
  the ordinary unwaxed, given in the previous directions. The picture may
  be developed by a complete immersion also in a saturated solution of
  gallic acid; but should it not have been exposed a sufficient time in the
  camera, a few drops of the aceto-nitrate solution added to the gallic
  acid greatly accelerates it. An excess of aceto-nitrate often produces an
  unpleasant red tint, which is to be avoided. Instead of complete
  immersion, the paper may be laid upon some waste blotting-paper, and the
  surface only wetted by means of the glass rod or brush. The picture may
  now be fixed by the use of the <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'hyposulphate', corrected by erratum in Issue 168."
  >hyposulphite</span> of soda, as in the preceding process.</p>

  <p>It is not actually necessary that this should be a wax-paper process,
  because ordinary paper treated in this way acts very beautifully,
  although it does not allow of so long keeping for use after excitement;
  yet it has then the advantage, that a negative may either be waxed or
  not, as shall be deemed advisable by its apparent depth of action.</p>

  <p><i>Exhibition of recent Specimens of Photography at the Society of
  Arts.</i>&mdash;This exhibition, to which all interested in the art have
  been invited to contribute, was inaugurated by a conversazione at the
  Society's rooms, on the evening of Wednesday, the 22nd of December: the
  public have since been admitted at a charge of sixpence each, and it will
  continue open until the 8th of January.</p>

  <p>We strongly recommend all our friends to pay a visit to this most
  delightful collection. By our visit at the crowded conversazione, and
  another hasty view since, we do not feel justified to enter into a review
  and criticism of the specimens so fully as the subject requires; but in
  the mean time we can assure our archæological readers that they will find
  there such interesting records of architectural detail, together with
  views of antiquities from Egypt and Nubia, as will perfectly convince
  them of the value of this art with reference to their own immediate
  pursuits. Those who feel less delight in mere antiquity will be gratified
  <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>to
  see, for the first time, that there are here shown photographs which aim
  at more than the bare copying of any particular spot; for many of the
  pictures here exhibited may rank as fine works of art. We feel much
  delicacy and hesitation in mentioning any particular artist, where so
  many are entitled to praise, especially in some particular departments.
  We could point out pictures having all the minute truthfulness of nature,
  combined with the beautiful effects of some of the greatest painters. We
  must, however, direct especial attention to the landscapes of Mr. Turner,
  the views in the Pyrenees by Mr. Stewart, and one splendid one of the
  same locality by Le Gray. Mr. Buckle's views in paper also exhibit a
  sharpness and detail almost equal to collodion; as do the various
  productions of Mr. Fenton in wax paper. The effects obtained also by Mr.
  Owen of Bristol appear to be very satisfactory: why they are, with so
  much excellence, called <i>experimental</i>, we cannot tell. In collodion
  Mr. Berger has exhibited some effective portraits; and we think the
  success of Mr. De la Motte has been so great, that in some of his
  productions little remains to be desired. We cannot conclude this brief
  notice without directing attention to the minuteness and pleasing effect
  of the views in Rome by M. Eugène Constant, which are also from
  collodion; as also the specimens from albumen negatives of M. Ferrier;
  and, lastly, to the pleasant fact that lady amateurs are now practising
  this art,&mdash;very nice specimens being here exhibited by the Ladies
  Nevill, whose example we shall hope to see followed.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Quotation in Locke</i> (Vol. vi., p. 386.).&mdash;The words "Si non
  vis intelligi non debes legi" were, I believe, the exclamation of St.
  Jerome, as he threw his copy of Persius into the fire in a fit of
  testiness at being unable to construe some tough lines of that tough
  author. I set down this reply from memory, and am unable to give the
  authority for it.</p>

  <p><i>Pic-nic</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 152. 518.).&mdash;The Query of A. F. S.
  (p. 152.) as to the etymology of <i>pic-nic</i> still remains unanswered.
  The Note of W. W. (p. 518.) merely refers to the time (1802) when pic-nic
  suppers first became fashionable in England. Under a French form, the
  word appears in a speech of Robespierre's, quoted in the <i>British and
  Foreign Review</i> for July, 1844, p. 620.: "C'est ici qu'il doit
  m'accuser, et non dans les <i>piques-niques</i>, dans les sociétés
  particulières." An earlier instance occurs in one of Lord Chesterfield's
  letters (No. 167.), dated October 1748.</p>

  <p><i>Discovery at Nuneham Regis</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 386. 488.
  558.).&mdash;Nuneham Regis was granted to John Dudley, Duke of
  Northumberland, in the seventh year of King Edward VI.; but as it was
  forfeited on his attainder, in the first year of Queen Mary, and
  immediately granted by her to Sir Rowland Hill, knight, and citizen of
  London, from whom Sir Thomas Leigh, knight, and alderman of London,
  almost immediately acquired it; and as he exercised the right of
  presentation to the vicarage in the first year of the reign of Queen
  Elizabeth, there is no probability of the body of John, Duke of
  Northumberland, being removed from the Tower of London to Newnham.</p>

  <p>The letters T. B. on the clothes on the body at Nuneham are distinctly
  worked in Roman capitals, like those on a common sampler. I have seen
  them.</p>

      <p>Or leeching guest, God keep my house."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Woodward</span> tells us that he quotes this
  inscription "from memory:" it is so very pertinent that it seems a pity
  even to hint a correction, but, as I read it, it seemed partly familiar
  to me, and I find something so like the latter part of it in two ancient
  authors, that I am tempted to inquire whether he may not have omitted
  <i>one letter</i>, which alters the sense as given above, and yet gives a
  sense as good.</p>

  <p>Among the Symbols of Pythagoras, I read the following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<span title="Omôrophious chelidônas mê echein" class="grk">&Omicron;&mu;&omega;&rho;&omicron;&phi;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &chi;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&omega;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf; &mu;&eta; &epsilon;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Domesticas hiru<i>n</i>dines ne habeto."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To the same effect (but, strange to say, without any reference to
  Pythagoras' dictum), we find it in the <i>proverbia</i> of Polydore
  Virgil (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1498):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p>"Hirundo garrula semper, <i>i.e.</i> garruli et tumigeri homines
  recipiendi non sunt."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I find no original for the former part of the inscription. Probably
  <span class="sc">Mr. Woodward</span> will agree with me, that it is
  difficult to decide whether a greedy or a gossipping guest would be the
  worst household infliction; but as a careful householder might well
  deprecate either, as matter of curiosity perhaps he would refer to the
  original inscription again, and decide whether he has or has not omitted
  an "n."</p>

  <p><i>Cross and Pile</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 386. 513.).&mdash;The <i>pile</i>
  is invariably on the obverse or <i>head</i> side of a coin; and
  <i>pile</i> or <i>poll</i> both mean the head, from whence the "poll tax"
  and "poll groat"&mdash;a tax paid by the head, or a personal tax, of
  which we have an historical example of its collector in the case of Wat
  Tyler.</p>

  <p>Ruding, in <i>Annals of the Coinage</i>, vol. ii. p. 119., 8vo., edit.
  1819, states that Ed. I. <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1304, in the
  delivering out the stamps for the coinage, orders that three <i>piles</i>
  and six <i>crosses</i> shall be given. It is well known to all
  numismatists that all, or most early coins, both Saxon and English, had a
  head on the obverse and a cross on the reverse&mdash;the latter being
  placed on the coins as symbolical of Christianity.</p>

  <p><i>Pile</i> also means the hair, or any filament: as the "pile of
  velvet, the nap of woollen cloth," &amp;c. And Jamieson, in his <i>Scotch
  Dictionary</i>, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Pile.</span> The soft hair which first appears on
  the chins of young men."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Coles, Ashe, Webster, and others give the same meaning.</p>

  <p>The superstitious effect of the cross as a charm or amulet is well
  known; from whence the saying:</p>

  <p>"I have never a cross in my purse to keep the Devil away."</p>

</blockquote>

  <i>Beehive of the Romish Church</i>, 1636, p. 251.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Nash, in the Supplication of Pierce Penniless to the Devil, makes
  Pierce to say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Whereas your impious excellence hath had the poore tenement of my
  purse anytime this half year for your dancing schole, and he,

  <p><i>Rhymes upon Places</i> (Vol. vi. p. 281.).&mdash;Perhaps you will
  think the following rhymes upon places worth insertion:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg3">"I stood upon Eyemouth Fort,</p>
      <p>And guess ye what I saw?</p>

      <p>The fairy fouk o' Fosterland,</p>

      <p>The bly-rigs o' Reston;</p>
      <p>But Dunse dings a'."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Near the seaside village of Eyemouth, in Berwickshire, is a promontory
  marked with a succession of grassy mounds, the remains of a fort built
  there in the regency of Mary of Lorraine. A number of places are
  represented as visible from the fort: but here fact is not strictly
  adhered to.</p>

  <p>Fosterland once existed in the parish of Bunkle as a small village;
  but even its vestiges are not now visible on the brown moor where it once
  stood. Edincran, properly Auchinchran, is an estate in the vicinity of
  Fosterland, as is Reston also. There is a variation as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The fairy fouk o' Fosterland,</p>

  >&#x1F00;&mu;&nu;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span> both denote a lamb. In John i.

  7., the Septuagint translation. But, in the Revelation, the word selected
  by the apostle is simply to be viewed as characteristic of his style.
  Taken in connexion with John i. 29. 36., the difference presents one of
  those points which so strikingly attest the authenticity of the
  Scripture. If the writer had drawn upon his imagination, in all
  likelihood he would have used the word <span title="arnion" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&rho;&nu;&#x1F77;&omicron;&nu;</span> in the Gospel; but he
  employed another, because the Baptist actually made use of a different
  one, <i>i. e.</i> one different from that which he was in the habit of
  employing.</p>

  <p><i>Who was the greatest General</i> (Vol. vi., p. 509.).&mdash;In
  reply to the following Query, "Who was the greatest general, and why and
  wherefore did the Duke of Wellington give the palm to Hannibal?" I think
  the following note appended to the eloquent sermon of Dr. Croly, preached
  on the death of the Duke, Sept. 19th, not only shows the humility of the
  Duke in giving preference to Hannibal over himself, but it contains so
  just a comparison between the two generals, that it deserves recording in
  the valuable and useful pages of the "N. &amp; Q." as well as being a
  perfect and true answer to C. T.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It has been usual," the note says, "to compare Wellington with
  Hannibal. But those who make the comparison seem to forget the
  facts:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hannibal, descending from the Alps with a disciplined force of 26,000
  men, met the brave Roman Militia, commanded by brave blockheads, and beat
  them accordingly. But, as soon as he was met by a man of common sense,
  Fabius, he could do nothing with him; when he met a man&oelig;uvring
  officer, the Consul Nero, he was outman&oelig;uvred, and lost his brother
  Asdrubal's army, which was equivalent to his losing Italy; and when he
  met an active officer, Scipio, he was beaten on his own ground. Finally,
  forced to take refuge with a foreign power, he was there a prisoner, and
  there he died."</p>

  <p>"His administrative qualities seem to have been of the humblest, or of
  the most indolent, order. For fourteen years he was in possession of, or
  in influence with, all the powers of southern Italy, then the richest
  portion of the peninsula. Yet this possession was wrested from him
  without an effort; and where he might have been a monarch, he was only a
  pensioner. His <i>punic</i> faith, his flight, his refuge, and his death
  in captivity, might find a more complete resemblance in the history of
  Napoleon."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following, concluding sentence of Dr. Croly's note conveys a truer
  and far more just comparison with another great general:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The life of the first Cæsar forms a much fairer comparison with that
  of Wellington. Both nobly born; both forcing their way up through the
  gradations of service, outstripping all their age; forming their
  characters by warfare in foreign countries; always commanding small
  armies, yet always invincible (Cæsar won the World at Pharsalia with only
  25,000 men): both alike courageous and clement, unfailing in resources,
  and indefatigable in their objects; receiving the highest rewards, and
  arising to the highest rank of their times; never beaten: both of
  first-rate ability in council. The difference being in their objects; one
  to serve himself, the other to serve his country; one impelled by
  ambition, the other by duty; one destroying the constitution of his
  country, the other sustaining it. Wellington, too, has given the soldier
  and statesman his 'Commentaries,' one of the noblest transcripts of a
  great administrative mind."</p>

  <p><i>Beech-trees struck by Lightning</i> (Vol. vi., p. 129.).&mdash;On
  Thinnigrove Common, near Nettlebed, Oxon, a beech-tree, one of three or
  four growing round a pit, was shattered by lightning about thirteen or
  fourteen years ago. A gentleman who has lived sixty years in the
  neighbourhood of the beech woods near Henly, tells me that he remembers
  three or four similar cases. Single beech-trees, which are very
  ornamental, generally grow very low and wide-spreading, which may be the
  reason why they often escape. On the other hand, in the woods where they
  run up close and very high, they present so many points of attraction to
  the electric fluid, that probably for that cause it is not often the case
  that one tree in particular is struck.</p>

  <p><i>Passage in Tennyson</i> (Vol. vi., p. 272.).&mdash;It appears to me
  that Tennyson has fallen into the error of a Latin construction. I call
  it an error, because in that language the varied terminations of the
  cases and numbers make that plain which we have no means of evidencing in
  English. I should translate it "Numenii strepitus volantis"&mdash;"The
  call of the curlew dreary (drearily) gleams about the moorland, <i>as he
  flies</i> o'er Locksley Hall." The summer note of the curlew is a shrill
  clear whistle, but in winter they sometimes indulge in a wild melancholy
  scream.</p>

  <p><i>Inscriptions in Churches</i> (Vol. vi., p. 510.).&mdash;I differ
  from your reply to <span class="sc">Norwood's</span> Query, in which you
  refer to the colloquy between Queen Elizabeth and Dean Nowell as the
  origin of these inscriptions. No doubt they were derived from the custom
  of our ante-Reformation ancestors, of painting figures and legends of
  saints upon the walls of churches; but the following instance will
  suffice to prove that they originated in the reign of Edward VI., and not
  in Queen Elizabeth's.</p>

  <p>In the interesting paper by the Rev. E. Venables in the
  <i>Transactions of the Cambridge Camden Society</i>, on "The Church of
  St. Mary the Great, Cambridge," he gives, under the year <!-- Page 26
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>1550, the
  following extracts from the churchwardens' accounts:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pl0 pr0 vtp" rowspan="3">"</td><td class="hang1on0 pr2">For makyng of the wall where Saynt<br/>
George stood in the chyrche</td>
<td class="ar vbm"> vj<sup>d</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td class="hang1on0 pr2"> It. payd for wythynge y<sup>e</sup> chyrch</td>
<td class="ar vbm"> xx<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td class="hang1on0 pr2"> It. payd for <i>wryghtynge of y<sup>e</sup> chyrch<br/>
walls with Scriptures</i></td>
<td class="ar vbm"> iiij<sup>lib</sup> iij<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d</sup>.</td><td class="pl0 pr0 vbm">"</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Shortly after the accession of Queen Mary in 1553, the following entry
  occurs:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pl0 pr0 vtp">"</td><td class="hang1on0 pr2">Payd to Barnes for mendyng over the rode<br/>
and over the altar in the chapell, and <i>for<br/>
washing oute the Scriptures</i></td>
<td class="ar vbm"> 4<sup>s</sup> 4<sup>d</sup>.</td><td class="pl0 pr0 vbm">"</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>They do not appear to have been restored after this, for in the year
  1840 some of the plaister between two of the windows of the south aisle
  peeling off, discovered traces of "wryghtynge" beneath; and I and another
  member of the Cambridge Camden Society spent some time in laying it bare,
  and after much difficulty made out that it was the Lord's Prayer in
  English, headed, "The Lord's Prayer, called the Paternoster," and written
  in the church text of the period, the whole enclosed in a sort of
  arabesque border; it was not merely whited over, but had evidently been
  partially effaced, or partly "washed oute," before being "concealed under
  its dreary shroud of whitewash." On examination there were traces of more
  of this writing between the other windows, but we had not time to make
  any further investigation, for the church was then being cleaned, and in
  a few days all that we had laid bare was again concealed under a veil of
  whitewash.</p>

  <p>Thus, I think, we may assign to the reign of Edward VI., not merely
  the obliteration of the numerous frescoes of St. Christopher, the great
  dome, &amp;c., which are now so constantly coming to light, but also the
  origin of "wryghtynge of y<sup>e</sup> chyrch walls with scriptures" in
  their stead, some ten or twelve years <i>earlier</i> than the remarkable
  colloquy between Queen Elizabeth and the worthy Dean of St. Paul's.</p>

  <p><i>Book-plates</i> (Vol. iii., p. 495.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr.

  about which I cannot offer any information. It is certain, however, that
  book-plates were used on the Continent at a very early period. I remember
  to have seen one, from a wood-block, which was cut by Albert Dürer for
  his friend Pirkheimer. As it is sixteen years since I saw it at the
  Imperial Library at Vienna, I cannot be expected to give a precise
  description; but (as far as I recollect) the wording of it was as
  follows: "Bilibaldi Pirckheimeri et Amicorum."</p>

  <p>A copy which I possess of Vesalius's great anatomical work (Basil,
  1555) has the book-plate of a former Duke of Mecklenburg pasted inside
  the cover. It is a woodcut, ten inches by six and a half, representing
  the ducal arms, surrounded by an ornamented border. Beneath are the date
  and inscription:</p>

  <p>I do not know what the first six letters stand for, nor is it worth

  <p>"<i>World without end</i>" (Vol. vi., p. 434.).&mdash;Besides the
  places named by F. A., this phrase occurs in the authorised version of
  the Bible, in Is. xlv. 17., Ep. iii. 21. There is no doubt it is
  idiomatic, and is even now occasionally used in conversation. Our
  translators render at least three Hebrew words "world," and as many Greek
  ones. One of the latter, and two of the former, properly refer to
  <i>time</i>, like the Latin <i>ævum sæculum</i>; and this also <!-- Page
  27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>appears to
  have been the original meaning of "world," as it is one which it
  certainly has frequently in the Scriptures. "World without end" is the
  idiomatic rendering, equivalent to "in sæcula sæculorum," which is a
  literal following of an idiom common in both the Hebrew and Greek
  Scriptures, and to be found in the Chaldee of the Book of Daniel. "World
  without end" does not occur, so far as I am aware, in the modern European
  languages, which generally either follow the Latin "in sæcula sæculorum;"
  or the German, and say, "eternally to eternity."</p>

  <p><i>Gloucester Ballads</i> (Vol. iv., p. 311.).&mdash;Since I inserted
  these ballads, I have been informed, that the one entitled a "Gloucester
  Ditty" was from the pen of Charles Dibdin, who, paying a visit to the
  "fair city," was pressed by some friends to leave them a memento of such.
  Of my own knowledge, I cannot vouch for the truth of this story; my
  informant's veracity is, however, unquestionable. I have recently
  obtained another copy; like the former, it is without a date, but bears
  the well-known imprint, "Raikes, Southgate Street."</p>

  <p>The "Old Harry" is intended for one "Harry Hudman, King of the
  Island," a low district in Gloucester, a mock officer chosen by the lower
  orders. Harry kept the throne many years, but was at length outvoted; but
  resolving to retain by stratagem what he could not by free choice,
  invited his competitor to a glass; and while the latter was taking his
  draught, Harry jumped into his seat, was chaired through the island, and
  was thus king another year. There was a ballad relating to this worthy,
  commencing&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"There was a man of renown,</p>
      <p>In Gloucester's fam'd town."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Another verse informs us that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"Old coffins ne'er new,</p>
      <p class="i4">And old pulpits too,</p>
      <p>Can be bought at his shop in the island."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The "Taylor's Tale" alluded to is a ballad, written by person of that
  name, on the manners and customs of the island. I have not been able to
  obtain copies of either of these just noticed ballads; and should any
  correspondent of "N. &amp; Q." possess such, they would oblige me by
  their insertion.</p>

  <p><i>Satirical Prints; Pope</i> (Vol. vi., p. 434.).&mdash;I have never
  seen this print that your correspondent refers to. It will no doubt be
  found, however, to be a plate illustrating a <i>scene</i> in the
  following tract: "<i>A Letter from Mr. Cibber to Mr. Pope, &amp;c.</i>:
  London, printed and sold by W. Lewis in Russell Street, Covent Garden,
  1742," see pp. 45, 46, 47, 48, 49., where is given rather a warm
  description of the whole scene. Should this tract not be had by <span
  class="sc">Griffin</span>, he may turn to D'Israeli's <i>Quarrels of
  Authors</i>, article "Pope and Cibber," note p. 193., col. 2., edit.
  8vo., Moxon, 1840; where D'Israeli adds:</p>

  <p><i>Raising the Wind</i> (Vol. vi., p. 486.).&mdash;We say "the wind

  v. 777.: <i>Georgics</i>, i. 356.; ii. 333.; and iii. 134.). The
  transition from rising to raising is easy; and as there is no sailing
  without a breeze, so there is no getting along without money: in both
  cases, the <i>wind</i> is essential to progress. As to the mode of
  obtaining the "needful," I know not much, but probably whistling will be
  found as effectual in one case as in the other.</p>

  <p><i>Milton in Prose</i> (Vol. vi., p. 340.).&mdash;I know of one
  performance in the French language, which answers the description of
  <i>Milton in Prose</i>: it is a rhapsody entitled <i>Le Paradis
  Terrestre, Poëme imité de Milton</i>, by Madame Dubocage: London, 1748.
  The French themselves had so poor an opinion of it, that one of their
  wits, the Abbé Yart, has ridiculed it in the following epigram:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sur cet écrit, charmante Dubocage,</p>

  to Lord Willoughby de Parham, but he does not say from whence he obtained
  it. I have now before me two copies, one in <i>Historical Anecdotes of

  <p><i>Can a Man baptize himself?</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 36. 110.).&mdash;This
  question has not yet received any <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>correct answer. The
  following quotation from the <i>Summa</i> of St. Thomas Aquinas will
  resolve it as far as your querist W. is concerned:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Similiter autem Forma mutaretur, si diceretur 'Ego baptizo me;' et
  ideo nullus potest baptizare seipsum propter quod et <span
  class="sc">Christus</span> a Joanne voluit
  baptizari."&mdash;<i>Summa</i>, 3<sup>tia</sup> Pars, Quæstio lxvi. Art.
  v. Arg. 4.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Rev. A. Gatty</span>, while right in the negative
  answer which he gives to the question of W., is quite wrong in the
  reasons on which he founds it. "Christian fellowship" is <i>not</i> of
  necessity a requisite for administering the sacrament of holy baptism. I
  quote again from the <i>Summa</i> of St. Thomas:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod Baptismum a schismaticis recipere non
  licet, nisi in articulo necessitatis: quia melius est de hâc vitâ cum
  signo <span class="sc">Christi</span> exire, a quocumque detur, etiam si
  sit Judæus vel Paganus, quam sine hoc signo, quod per Baptismum
  confertur."&mdash;<i>Summa</i>, 2<sup>nda</sup> Pars, Quæstio xxxix. Art.
  iv. Arg. 1.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As our own Church apparently only recognises sacerdotal baptism in her
  formularies, in answering such a question as that of W. we must have
  recourse to the schoolmen and casuists of earlier times.</p>

  <p>PHOTOGRAPHIC CHEMICALS of absolute Purity, especially prepared for
  this Art, may be procured from R. W. THOMAS, Operative Chemist, 10. Pall
  Mall, whose well-known Preparation of Xylo-Iodide of Silver is pronounced
  by the most eminent scientific men of the day to excel every other
  Photographic Compound in sensitiveness, and in the marvellous vigour
  uniformly preserved in the middle tints of pictures produced by it. MR.
  R. W. THOMAS cautions Photographers against unprincipled persons who
  (from the fact of Xyloidin and Collodion being synonymous terms) would
  lead them to imagine that the inferior compound sold by them at half the
  price is identical with his preparation. In some cases even the name of
  of MR. T.'s Xylo-Iodide of Silver has been assumed. In order to prevent
  such dishonourable practice, each bottle sent from his Establishment is
  stamped with a red label bearing his signature, to counterfeit which is

  <p>DEMOCRITUS IN LONDON; with the Mad Pranks and Conceits of Motley and
  Robin Goodfellow: to which are added Notes Festivous, &amp;c. By GEORGE
  DANIEL, Author of "Merrie England in the Olden Time," "The Modern
  Dunciad," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"An exquisite metrical conceit, sparkling with wit and humour, in the
  true spirit of Aristophanes, in which Democritus guides his brilliant and
  merry muse through every fantastic measure, evincing grace in the most
  grotesque attitudes. As a relief to his cutting sarcasm and fun, the
  laughing philosopher has introduced some fine descriptive scenes, and
  passages of deep pathos, eloquence, and beauty. Not the least remarkable
  feature in this very remarkable book are the recondite and curious notes,
  at once so critical and philosophical, so varied and so amusing, so full
  of interesting anecdote and racy reminiscences. They form a rich mine of
  classical learning and antiquarian knowledge. To genius and virtue
  Democritus will prove a delightful companion and friend, but a
  well-pickled rod to vice and folly&mdash;a scourge to make wince hollow
  pretenders of every kind&mdash;even down to the critical impostor and the
  stage-struck buffoon."&mdash;See <i>Athenæum</i>, <i>Critic</i>,

  <p>"Bids fair to be the most beautiful and attractive of the 'Gift Books'
  of the present season. The designs, which are for the most part
  exceedingly good, have been lithographed, and printed in colours, so as
  to present the appearance of exquisite and really well-finished drawings,
  and the letter-press is compiled from the works of our most standard
  writers. This, in our opinion, is by far the best plan for illustrated
  works. The words should be worthy of the pictures, and then those who go
  to the expense of such works have the satisfaction of knowing that they
  have got the best of their kind, in both the text and the illustrations,
  instead of having, as is too often the case, capital pictures and second
  or third-rate prose or poetry. The book before us is, in every way,
  worthy to be placed upon the drawing-room table of her most gracious
  Majesty, and we doubt not that it will shortly be found
  there."&mdash;<i>English Churchman.</i></p>

  <p>"'Poetry of the Year' is a most richly illustrated volume, containing
  more than a score of beautiful designs lithographed and printed in
  colours with a delightful effect. Several of them (we may instance the
  timber waggon on the wintry road, the rich summer sunset, the view of
  Windermere, the group of cattle, and the children gathering spring
  flowers) have the effect of finished water-colour drawings; and when we
  add that among the contributors of designs are Mr. Creswick, Mr. David
  Cox, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Davidson, Mr. Weir, E. V. B., and others hardly less
  admired, the reader will understand that the volume is above the average
  of illustrated books generally. We have to say also that the accompanying
  passages from the poets are extremely well made, with a true feeling and
  a catholic taste. The volume well deserves
  success."&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

  <p>"This is a charming volume, as much to be prized for the value of the
  letter-press, as admired for the beauty of the illustrations&mdash;a
  remark applicable to few books so ornamental. The poetry consists of
  selections from English classic authors, on subjects connected with the
  four seasons....</p>

  <p>Altogether, the volume is worthy of high praise, and will doubtless be
  a favourite gift-book of the new year, having also the advantage of being
  a book of pleasant reference for all the year round."&mdash;<i>Literary
  Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"Mr. Arnold has succeeded in preparing a work admirably adapted to
  meet the wants of English students of the French Language. The
  philosophical explanation of the changes of consonants, together with the
  frequent references to Latin words and idioms by way of illustration and
  comparison, render it far superior as a school-book to any other
  introduction, even from the pen of a native writer. The sound principles
  of imitation and repetition which have secured for the author a
  reputation widely extended and well deserved, are here happily
  exemplified. His account of the differences of idiom is very satisfactory
  and complete:&mdash;whoever thoroughly masters it, will rarely want
  anything further on the subject."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
